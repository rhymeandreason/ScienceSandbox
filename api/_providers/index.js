/* =============================================================================
 *  _providers/index.js — which model answers the question
 * =============================================================================
 *  `AI_PROVIDER` in the environment picks one. A provider is any module with
 *  `{id, label, envKey, model, PRICE, CACHE_MIN,
 *    ask({system, context, messages, schema})}`
 *  that returns `{json, usage:{input, output, cached}}`, so adding a third is a
 *  file and a line in PROVIDERS, and `_tutor.js` never learns its name.
 *
 *  `system` and `context` arrive separately because they are priced separately:
 *  `system` is byte-stable for a whole lesson and every vendor sells it back
 *  cheap, `context` is this turn's step and screen readings. A provider that
 *  concatenates them still answers correctly and quietly pays full rate.
 *
 *  `CACHE_MIN` is the shortest prompt this model will cache: a number, `null`
 *  where the model does not cache at all, or `undefined` where nobody has
 *  measured it. It lives here for the same reason PRICE does - it is a fact
 *  about a model, the model is a knob, and it is not guessable from the tier.
 *
 *  `pick` takes `bench` as an ARGUMENT rather than reading an environment flag.
 *  A request may name its provider only on a bench, and whether this is a bench
 *  is the transport's question to answer (`api/_local.js`), not a global for a
 *  module three call-levels down to read. In production it is always false, so
 *  a visitor cannot choose which key to spend.
