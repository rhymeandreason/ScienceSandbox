/* =============================================================================
 *  api/land.js — where a question actually landed
 * =============================================================================
 *  POST /api/land  {q, tier, target, visitorId}  → 204, always
 *
 *  THE SERVER USED TO BE UNABLE TO KNOW THIS, AND THAT WAS FINE. api/find.js
 *  returns a vector and the PAGE ranks it, so the outcome never came back —
 *  and when that was written a find WAS the search, so re-scoring the text
 *  offline reproduced the answer exactly. `_schema.sql` still explains the
 *  trade; this endpoint is what changed under it.
 *
 *  The bar now walks six tiers, and `/api/find` is reached only by the last
 *  two. A reader who typed `rubisco` and landed on a card by NAME, or restored
 *  a graft they had built last week, or was offered a new question, never
 *  embedded anything — so those arrivals are invisible to the log, and they
 *  are most of them. Re-scoring cannot recover a tier it was never part of.
 *  What is worth knowing is exactly what is now underivable: which tier is
 *  carrying the map, and which questions fall through to a guess.
 *
 *  A BEACON, SO THE READER PAYS NOTHING. `navigator.sendBeacon` is
 *  fire-and-forget: it does not block the arrival, it survives the page being
 *  closed a moment later, and it cannot fail in a way the reader sees. This
 *  answers 204 and never a body, because nothing is waiting for one.
 *
 *  IT UPDATES BEFORE IT INSERTS. A semantic arrival already wrote a row from
 *  api/find.js, and writing a second would put one question in the log twice —
 *  which is the exact complaint this whole line of work started from. So the
 *  landing is folded into that row when it exists, and only an arrival that
 *  called no endpoint at all gets a row of its own, tagged `land`.
 *
 *  A `land` ROW IS NOT SPEND, and the rate limiter skips it. The cap in
 *  _finds.js counts rows to ration API calls; a landing made none, and
 *  counting it would throttle a reader for using the offline half of the bar.
 * ========================================================================== */
