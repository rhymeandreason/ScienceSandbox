/* =============================================================================
 *  _catalog.js — the seven chapters, and which lesson page (if any) teaches one
 * =============================================================================
 *  The tutor may only cite ids from this list. They are baked into the response
 *  schema as an enum, so the model cannot invent a chapter or link a page that
 *  does not exist. `page: null` means the chapter is real but unbuilt: the box
 *  names it and offers no link.
 *
 *  `covers` is read by the model, not by a human. It is what a student's wording
 *  has to match against, so it holds the words a student would actually use.
 *
 *  Node-loadable and DOM-free, so `demos/ask/check-ask.js` and the API resolve
 *  the same pages from the same source.
