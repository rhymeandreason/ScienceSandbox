/* =============================================================================
 *  _targets.js — what the tutor is allowed to point at, across the lessons
 * =============================================================================
 *  The same trick as the chapter catalog, one level in. A target id goes into
 *  the response schema as an enum, so the tutor can pick one or pick none and
 *  cannot invent a third thing. The page owns what an id then does; nothing
 *  here knows about Focus, Hotspot or the camera.
 *
 *  IDS ARE QUALIFIED, `lesson/target`, because the tutor can aim off the page
 *  the student is on. Two renderings, and they are different affordances:
 *
 *    · a target in the current lesson  → act in place, no navigation
 *    · a target in another lesson      → a link that leaves this page
 *
 *  ONLY `step` TARGETS TRAVEL. A control you cannot reach is not a destination,
 *  and a molecular focus depends on what that scene has currently built. So a
 *  lesson offers its whole list at home and only its steps to everyone else,
 *  which is also what keeps the prompt from growing by a lesson at a time.
 *
 *  `what` is written for the model, not for a student. It is what a question's
 *  wording has to match against, so it says what the thing IS and what it does,
 *  in the words a beginner would use.
 *
 *  Every claim in here is checked by `demos/ask/check-ask.js`: a `ui` target
 *  names a DOM id that must exist in the lesson, a `step` target names a title
 *  that must appear in it, and `deepLink` must be true only where the page
 *  really does read its parameter from the URL. That last one matters: without
 *  it a link silently lands on the right page at the wrong place.

    /* How this simulation BEHAVES, as opposed to what the science is. A student
     * stuck on the sim asks a science question, and the honest answer is often
     * about the sim: with three molecules on screen there is almost nothing to
     * bond to, and explaining hydrogen bonding again does not help.
     *
     * Written for the model, and paired with the live readings the page sends,
     * so a note can be conditional on a number the tutor can actually see. */
