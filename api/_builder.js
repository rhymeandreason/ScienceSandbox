/* =============================================================================
 *  api/_builder.js — one app from the component reference, and every edit after
 * =============================================================================
 *  The thinking behind `api/build.js` and `demos/tools/gen-app.js`, which are
 *  two transports for the same three calls: a first DRAFT from a request, an
 *  EDIT as a list of find/replace pairs against the current page, and the
 *  WHOLE-file fallback an edit takes when one of its finds does not land. The
 *  script is the eval and the endpoint is the product, and they must not drift
 *  into two ideas of what the model is told, so neither holds a prompt.
 *
 *  THE MODEL SEES ONE DOCUMENT. `docs/Components.md` is the whole reference,
 *  and it is the SYSTEM prompt on every call, byte-stable across drafts and
 *  edits alike, so the provider caches it once and reads it back cheap for the
 *  rest of the hour. What differs per turn — the page, the errors it last
 *  threw, the request — rides in the uncached half. Generator.md says why the
 *  reference is not padded with example pages.
 *
 *  EDITS ARE PAIRS, NOT PAGES. Four of five measured edits touched under forty
 *  lines and returned two hundred and forty; output is the bill. A `find` is a
 *  passage copied from the page, occurring exactly once, and `replace` is what
 *  takes its place. Applied here, in order, and a find that occurs zero or two
 *  times fails the whole list rather than guessing, because a guessed edit is
 *  a change nobody asked for. A find that lands but splices badly fails the
 *  same way, one step later, when the page it made does not parse. The
 *  fallback for either is one more call for the whole file, with the failure
 *  quoted, and then it stops: a second failure is a finding about the
 *  reference, not something to paper over.
 *
 *  RETRY ONCE ON A SYNTAX ERROR, NEVER ON A SEMANTIC ONE. `validate` reads the
 *  page's source: scripts only from the library or the one CDN the reference
 *  names, every `mount` on a component the reference has with the scripts its
 *  section lists, the shell loaded, and every inline script parsing. A page
 *  failing that is worth one more attempt with the problems quoted. A page that passes and
 *  is wrong is a gap in a component or the reference, and the eval exists to
 *  expose exactly that.
 *
 *  THE PAGE CARRIES ITS OWN HISTORY. A comment after the doctype lists the
 *  requests that shaped it, oldest first. The model reads it, so "make it
 *  bigger" after "add a chart" is about the chart; an eval replays it; and the
 *  server rebuilds it after every turn, so the model is told to leave it alone.
