/* =============================================================================
 *  api/_apps.js — the apps table, and how many builds a link has left
 * =============================================================================
 *  Everything that touches `apps` and `app_versions` is here, so the two
 *  endpoints (`build.js` writes turns, `app.js` reads and saves) cannot drift
 *  into two ideas of what a version is. `_schema.sql` says what the rows mean.
 *
 *  THE EDIT TOKEN IS A BEARER SECRET, hashed at rest the way `_keys.js` hashes
 *  a cohort key and compared the same way. It protects one row. It is minted
 *  once, handed to whoever created or remixed the app, and never readable back
 *  out of the database: a leaked dump gives away nothing anyone can save with.
 *
 *  THE LIMIT IS ITS OWN, not `_limit.js`'s. A build costs many times what a
 *  question does and is counted in a different table, so it gets its own
 *  constants and its own one-round-trip query. The shape is the tutor's: the
 *  cohort cap is the protection, the visitor cap is friction, and it FAILS OPEN
 *  for the same reason — the provider's prepaid cap is the ceiling that always
 *  holds, and a slow database must not take the builder away from a tester
 *  mid-thought.
 *
 *  UNLIKE THE TUTOR, THIS DOES NOT NO-OP WITHOUT A COHORT. The tutor's limiter
 *  returns null when there is no cohort because an ungated deployment is a
 *  local one. A builder without a database cannot store anything at all, so
 *  `enabled()` is the gate the endpoints check first, and with a database the
 *  visitor cap applies whether or not a key was presented.
 * ========================================================================== */
