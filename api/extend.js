 *  GET  /api/extend  → whether the endpoint is configured
 *  POST /api/extend  {q, candidates, index, context} → {question, note, nodes, edges}
 *
 *  A reader asks something Bio 101 does not cover — "how do fish breathe
 *  underwater?" — and the map has every PIECE (diffusion, surface-area-to-
 *  volume, a transport protein) and no card that assembles them. Today the
 *  search routes that question to photosynthesis, confidently, because
 *  photosynthesis is the closest thing baked. This answers it by drawing the
 *  bridge instead: two or three new cards, each wired to a card that already
 *  exists.
 *
 *  IT MAY ONLY ATTACH TO WHAT IS ALREADY THERE, and it is shown ALL of it.
 *  Two lists arrive: `index`, every card on the map as id and name, and
 *  `candidates`, the dozen the page's vector search ranked highest, with their
 *  claims. Every edge has to name an id from one of those or a node proposed
 *  in the same reply; anything else is dropped here AND again in the page,
 *  which resolves against `byId` before it draws.
 *
 *  THE INDEX IS THERE BECAUSE RETRIEVAL PICKS THE WRONG NEIGHBOURS. Measured:
 *  "how do fish breathe underwater" ranks photosynthesis first and never
 *  surfaces `simple-diffusion` or `sa-v`, which are the cards that actually
 *  explain a gill — they say "molecules spread because they move at random"
 *  and never say oxygen. Given only the retrieval, the model wired gills to
 *  AQUATIC OVERWINTERING, which is anchored and absurd. Two hundred ids and
 *  names is about a thousand tokens; the whole map is cheaper than being
 *  wrong.
 *
 *  RANK 2 OR 3, NEVER 1. Rank 1 is the authored spine — what a card deals
 *  first, what the walk steps along, what sizes a hub. Generated material is
 *  enrichment by construction, and the schema will not express anything else.
 *
 *  NOTHING HERE IS PERSISTED, and that is what makes it safe. The page spawns
 *  these as satellites: pinned, outside the layout, dropped when focus leaves.
 *  A generated node cannot move a laid-out card, cannot close a cycle on the
 *  explanation axis, and cannot spend a rank-1 budget, because it never enters
 *  the pass that would do any of those things. The blast radius of a wrong
 *  answer is one card the reader is looking at.
 *
 *  THE MAP'S UNITS ARE ITS FLOOR, NOT ITS FENCE. A reader asks about gluten
 *  intolerance or gills, and the answer is a CHAIN from a card the map has up
 *  to the thing they asked about. `note` is the bridge sentence: which
 *  mechanism on the map the answer runs through. It used to be a refusal
 *  ("outside the map") printed over a graft the model had built anyway, which
 *  disowned the answer it was giving.

const SYSTEM = `You extend a concept map for a college Biology 101 course.

The map is cards and typed, directed edges. A card is a NAME and a CLAIM: one
or two sentences, present tense, concrete, no hedging, under 110 characters.
Write the way a good tutor talks, not the way a textbook does. Never open with
"This is" or "X is the process by which".

You are given the reader's question, the map's INDEX — every card, as id and
name — and CANDIDATES, the handful a search ranked closest, with their claims.
Propose at most ${MAXNODES} new cards that answer the question, and the edges
that connect them.

The map's units — water and bonding, macromolecules, protein structure, the
cell and its membrane, molecular genetics, respiration, photosynthesis — are
its FLOOR, not its fence. Readers ask about organs, disease, ecology, whatever
they are curious about, and the answer is a CHAIN: start from the card whose
mechanism the answer runs through and build up to the thing they asked about,
one card per step, the general mechanism at the map end. Gluten intolerance is
peptide → immune recognition → immune attack → gut lining, hung on protein
shape. Never refuse a question for being above the map's scale.

Attach to the card whose MECHANISM explains the answer, which is often not one
of the candidates: the search ranks by wording, and the right card frequently
does not use the reader's words at all. Read the index for it.

THE READER IS LOOKING AT SOMETHING, and the question is asked of it. You are
told the card in focus, the cards on screen and the questions asked before
this one. A terse line — "what are some examples", "why?", "and then?" — is
about the card in focus, and "this" or "that" means it. Examples arrive as
cards, each wired with "illustrates" to what it exemplifies.

"question" is the reader's line restated as one full question that stands on
its own, under 90 characters, naming the card where they used a pronoun or
none: "what are some examples" becomes "What are some examples of countercurrent
exchange?". Keep a line that already stands alone as it is.

An id beginning "made:" is a card the reader built from an earlier question
this session, and it is in the index like any other. Where the new question
continues that line, attach to it: the chain climbs one question at a time.

RULES, and a reply breaking one is discarded:
- Every edge's "from" and "to" must be either an id from the index or the
  candidates, exactly as given, or the id of a card you are proposing in this
  same reply. Invent no other id.
- At least one edge must reach an EXISTING card. A cluster floating free of the
  map is not an answer.
- Attach where the claim is really true. An edge to a card that merely shares a
  topic word is worse than no edge.
- DIRECTION IS A CLAIM. "A causes B" says A explains B, and the map reads left
  to right along it. The general mechanism comes first and the special case
  second: diffusion enables a gill, a gill does not enable diffusion.
- New ids are lowercase, hyphenated, and describe the card: "gill", "countercurrent".
- rank 2 for the main link, rank 3 for a side one. Never rank 1.
- "note" is one sentence to the reader, shown under the cards: which mechanism
  on the map the answer runs through, said as an on-ramp, never as a
  disclaimer about what the map does not cover.
- Propose FEWER cards rather than padding: as many as the chain needs, no more.
- Every claim must be true. If you are not sure of a mechanism, leave it out.`;
