# Scientific Accuracy Rules — Water Visualization

Rules and decisions that keep `water-lab.html` scientifically honest. When adding or
tweaking a visualization, check it against these before shipping. The guiding
principle:

> **Accuracy comes from the coordinates and the forces, not from the rendering
> library.** A pretty render of wrong geometry is still wrong. Prefer computing
> real positions/interactions over eyeballing them.

## 1. Molecular geometry

- **Bond angle is 104.5°**, not 90° or 120°. The H–O–H angle is used verbatim in
  the 3D molecule builder and the 2D diagrams.
- Water is **bent / V-shaped** — never draw it linear.
- **Relative atom sizes:** O is drawn larger than H (O has more electrons / larger
  van der Waals radius). Keep O clearly bigger than H.
- O–H bond lengths in the model are stylized (enlarged for legibility), but the
  *angle* and *bent shape* must stay correct. If a length is exaggerated, say so
  in a comment rather than implying it's to scale.

## 2. Polarity & charge

- Oxygen is **more electronegative** → it carries the partial negative charge
  (**δ−**); each hydrogen carries partial positive (**δ+**).
- The **dipole points toward oxygen** (the negative end).
- The electron cloud / density is shown **shifted toward O**, never symmetric.

## 3. Electrons & covalent bonding

- A **covalent bond = a shared pair of electrons** (one from each atom). Show it as
  a pair, not a single dot or a plain stick when the lesson is about electrons.
- Oxygen has **two bonding pairs and two lone pairs** (4 electron domains,
  tetrahedral-ish). Both lone pairs must be shown when depicting O's electrons.
- Bonding pairs sit **closer to O** than to H (electronegativity), consistent with
  the δ−/δ+ story.

## 4. Hydrogen bonds

- An H-bond is an **intermolecular** attraction between a **δ+ H of one molecule**
  and a **δ− O (lone pair) of another** — never within the same molecule, never
  H-to-H or O-to-O.
- **Strength:** ~1/20 of a covalent bond. State this ratio; don't draw H-bonds
  with the same weight/style as covalent bonds. Convention here: covalent = solid
  stick, H-bond = **dashed** teal connector.
- **Directionality:** strongest when **O–H···O is close to linear**. Detection and
  forces are weighted by the alignment (dot product of the O–H direction and the
  H···O direction); bent geometries are weaker or rejected.
- **One donor H → at most one H-bond.** Each H forms a single H-bond (to the best
  aligned, nearest acceptor within range), so counts stay physical. A real water
  molecule participates in up to 4 H-bonds total (2 as donor, 2 as acceptor).
- **It is an attractive force.** When a bond forms it must actually *pull* the two
  molecules together toward an **equilibrium O···O distance**, balanced by
  short-range steric (Pauli) repulsion as a hard core. Molecules should latch into
  a cohesive network, not drift through each other. (Distances in `water.html` are
  scene units, not Ångström — the *behavior* is what must be right: attract when
  far, repel when too close, settle at equilibrium.)

## 5. Ice (solid water)

- Freezing produces the **real hexagonal ice (Iₕ) lattice**, built from actual
  crystallography — not a decorative grid:
  - Each oxygen is **tetrahedrally bonded to four others**.
  - Structure is **puckered hexagonal bilayers, ABAB-stacked** (hexagonal, not
    cubic ABCABC).
  - **One hydrogen bridges every O···O** linkage (ice rules: each O donates 2 H,
    accepts 2).
  - Real **O···O ≈ 2.76 Å**; the lattice is **more open than liquid**.
- **Ice is less dense than liquid water → it floats.** The frozen state must
  visibly occupy more volume / be more open than the liquid state. This is the
  whole point of the lesson; never let ice look denser than liquid.
- No atom overlap during the freeze/melt animation — molecules must not pass
  through each other (enforced by collision resolution, see §7).

## 6. Emergent properties must trace back to H-bonding

Every "special property" lesson should visibly connect to hydrogen bonding:

- **Cohesion / surface tension** — H-bonds pull molecules together.
- **Adhesion / capillary action** — narrower tube → higher rise (correct
  direction of the effect).
- **High specific heat / heat of vaporization** — added heat first goes into
  **breaking H-bonds** before molecules speed up / escape. Evaporation happens at
  high energy, not low.
- **Solvent** — polar water surrounds ions in **hydration shells**: δ− O faces
  cations (e.g. Na⁺), δ+ H faces anions (e.g. Cl⁻). Orientation must be correct.

## 7. Physics / simulation integrity

- **No interpenetration.** Spheres representing atoms/molecules must not visibly
  overlap during animation. Use position-based collision resolution or a repulsion
  force with a floor below any attractive equilibrium.
- **Stable integration.** Damp velocities; keep force constants low enough that the
  sim doesn't explode. Sanity-check by measuring max velocity after settling.
- **Equilibrium first.** When both attraction and repulsion act on the same pair,
  set the steric floor *below* the attractive equilibrium so bonded pairs rest at
  the intended distance instead of the two forces fighting.
- **Counts must be believable.** If a readout reports a quantity (e.g. number of
  H-bonds), verify it against the geometry — an 8-molecule cluster showing 100+
  H-bonds is a bug (it was: molecules had collapsed with no repulsion).

## 8. Rendering caveats to remember

- **WebGL ignores line width** — thin `THREE.Line` H-bonds are effectively
  invisible and get occluded. Render bonds that need to be *seen* as thin
  cylinders/tubes, not lines.
- Prefer **real computed coordinates** over hand-placed approximations for any
  crystal/lattice/geometry claim.
- Keep pedagogical exaggerations (enlarged bonds, spacing for legibility)
  **explicit in comments** so they aren't mistaken for to-scale facts.

## 9. Reaction & event animation reference (`fx.js`)

Every "something happened" moment in a simulation is marked by a transient effect.
These live in the shared **`fx.js`** module (same reuse pattern as `molecules.js`)
so every page gets identical visuals. Each page creates one instance bound to its
own scene:

```js
const FXi = FX.create(THREE, root, camera);   // root: group the molecules live in
FXi.spawnRing(pos, color);  FXi.popGlow(g, color);  …
FXi.step();                                    // once per frame, in loop()
```

Effects are stepped off a wall-clock delta (frame-rate independent) and are
**purely cosmetic** — they never feed back into the physics, the H-bond counts,
or the pH readout. `popGlow` scales *relative* to a target's current scale, so it
works on both a molecule Group (rest scale 1) and a bare ion mesh (rest scale =
its radius) without resizing it.

### Guiding principle — intensity tracks the chemistry

The loudness of the effect is proportional to what actually happened. **Bonds
breaking or forming** get the full shockwave-and-sparks treatment; **hydration**
(no bonds broken, identity unchanged) gets only a soft shimmer; a solute where
**nothing happens** stays visually silent. Never dramatize a non-event — an
animation on plain dissolving would imply a reaction that didn't occur, and
methane's *silence* is itself the lesson about nonpolar solutes.

### Effect primitives

| Function | What it draws | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `spawnRing(pos,color)` | white core flash + double additive shockwave ring + 16-spark burst | bond break/form events |
| `popGlow(g,color)` | emissive flash (2.2×) + springy scale overshoot on a molecule's atoms | a molecule freshly formed / an ion tearing free |
| `settleShimmer(g,color)` | soft emissive breathe in-and-out, **no** scale/ring/sparks | a polar solute locking into its hydration shell |
| `protonHop(from,to,onArrive)` | glowing proton arcing between points with a fading comet trail | the H⁺ transfer of an acid ionization |
| `colorOf(g)` | reads a molecule's first **atom** colour (skips covalent-bond meshes) | tinting an effect to whatever it decorates |

### Per-molecule event → effect → colour

Atom/palette colours are the single source of truth in `molecules.js`
(`MolLib.PALETTE.atoms`); ion effects pull them live via `colorOf`.

| Molecule | `class` | Event | Effect(s) | Colour(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Water** H₂O | `solvent` | — (the medium; ambient H-bond network) | none | — |
| **Salt** NaCl | `ionic` | water bridges the pair → **dissociation** | `spawnRing` + `popGlow` each ion | ring/Na⁺ violet `#9a3fe0`, Cl⁻ green `#1fa968` |
| **Potassium chloride** KCl | `ionic` | same → **dissociation** | `spawnRing` + `popGlow` each ion | ring/K⁺ blue `#0054c0`, Cl⁻ green `#1fa968` |
| **Ethanol** C₂H₅OH | `polar` | settles into water → hydration toast | `settleShimmer` (in sync with toast) | water-blue `#9fd4ff` |
| **Ammonia** NH₃ | `polar` | settles into water → hydration toast | `settleShimmer` (in sync with toast) | water-blue `#9fd4ff` |
| **Methane** CH₄ | `nonpolar` | squeezed out (no H-bonds) | **none** (silence is the point) | — |
| **Carbon dioxide** CO₂ | `reactive` | **step 1:** CO₂ + H₂O → H₂CO₃ | `spawnRing` at attack site + `popGlow` on new H₂CO₃ | cool blue: ring `#7cc4ff`, glow `#bfe4ff` |
| ↳ **Carbonic acid** H₂CO₃ | `polar`, `product` | **step 2:** H₂CO₃ → HCO₃⁻ + H⁺ | `popGlow` on HCO₃⁻ + `protonHop` acid→water | glow `#ffe4b0`; proton `#ffe08a`, trail `#ffcf6b` |
| ↳ **Bicarbonate** HCO₃⁻ | `ion`, `product` | (formed in step 2) | — (glowed as part of step 2) | `#ffe4b0` |
| ↳ **Hydronium** H₃O⁺ | `ion`, `product` | proton lands on a water | `spawnRing` at landing + `popGlow` on new H₃O⁺ | warm amber: ring `#ffc24d`, glow `#ffd98a` |

### Colour language

- **Cool blue** (`#7cc4ff` / `#bfe4ff`) — a **water-driven** step: hydration, water
  attacking the carbon.
- **Warm amber** (`#ffc24d` / `#ffd98a` / `#ffe08a`) — **acid / proton** chemistry;
  echoes the amber ion–dipole bond colour and the falling-pH story.
- **Ion palette** (violet / blue / green) — dissociation flares each ion in its own
  identity colour so cation and anion read as distinct.
- **Water-blue** (`#9fd4ff`) — the **hydration shell closing in**; deliberately a
  water colour, not the solute's, because the solute is unchanged.
- The **white core flash** (`#ffffff`) is shared by all `spawnRing` events — the
  neutral white-hot instant before the coloured rings take over.

### Where each is wired

- Dissociation — `checkDissociation()` (at the "pop apart" impulse). Wired in
  **both** `water-lab.html` and `molecule-lab.html`.
- CO₂ chain — `updateReactions()` (step 1 hydration, step 2 ionization) —
  `molecule-lab.html`.
- Solute settle — `updateSolutes()`, at the moment descent ends and the hydration
  toast fires (gated to `class === 'polar'`) — `molecule-lab.html`.

New pages: add `<script src="fx.js">`, call `FX.create(THREE, root, camera)` once,
`FXi.step()` in the loop, and call the primitives at your own event sites.
