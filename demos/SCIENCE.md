# Scientific Accuracy Rules

The rulebook for every page in this project. **§1 governs adding any molecule**
(§1.1–§1.6); §§2–8 are chemistry and the water/solvation physics; §§9–13 are
per-page. When adding or tweaking a visualization, check it against these before
shipping. The guiding principle:

> **Accuracy comes from the coordinates and the forces, not from the rendering
> library.** A pretty render of wrong geometry is still wrong. Prefer computing
> real positions/interactions over eyeballing them.

## 1. Molecular geometry

### 1.1 Angles and shape

- **Bond angle is 104.5°**, not 90° or 120°. The H–O–H angle is used verbatim in
  the 3D molecule builder and the 2D diagrams.
- Water is **bent / V-shaped** — never draw it linear.
- **Relative atom sizes:** O is drawn larger than H (O has more electrons / larger
  van der Waals radius). Keep O clearly bigger than H.
- O–H bond lengths in the model are stylized (enlarged for legibility), but the
  *angle* and *bent shape* must stay correct. If a length is exaggerated, say so
  in a comment rather than implying it's to scale.

### 1.2 Where geometry comes from

Three sources, and the choice is not about how "complex" a molecule looks. The
question is whether its shape follows from **one or two known constants** or
**emerges from many coupled constraints**.

1. **Hand-written** — small molecules defined by a known angle, where the spec
   doubles as teaching material in its comments. Water (104.5°), methane (109.5°),
   ammonia (~107°), CO₂ (linear), the small ions. These are verifiably right today;
   don't churn them, and don't trade their readable annotated layout for an opaque
   coordinate block.
2. **Generated from a real record** (`tools/sdf2spec.js`, PubChem 3D) — branching
   skeletons, conformational freedom, or more than a handful of coordinates to
   type. The amino acids. The cost is real: generated specs are unreadable numbers
   carrying a "regenerate, don't hand-edit" warning, so only pay it when hand
   placement would actually drift.
3. **Generated from VSEPR** (`Skel` in `molecules.js`) — the glycolysis
   intermediates. First-principles derivation rather than a database, so it also
   covers the charged species PubChem has no 3D conformer for (bicarbonate,
   pyruvate, HPO₄²⁻), and it produces the deliberate flat Fischer-projection
   layout the lesson wants. Don't "upgrade" these to PubChem — it's a downgrade.

Whatever the source, run `check-molecules.js`.

### 1.3 Stereochemistry is the error nothing else catches

**Bond lengths, bond angles and the render can all be perfect while the molecule
is a different substance.** Nothing but an explicit stereo audit sees it, so a
spec **declares** what it expects and `check-molecules.js` fails if the geometry
disagrees:

```js
stereo:'all-equatorial',   // β-D-glucopyranose — asserted, not assumed
```

Glucose shipped wrong this way — substituents alternating axial/equatorial, not
glucose, and at C5 not even D-. All-equatorial is what makes glucose the most
stable of the 16 aldohexoses and much of why the pathway is built around it, so
it is a chemical claim and gets asserted like one.

**A real record is not a guarantee — your transform can destroy what you fetched
it for.** PubChem supplied L-amino acids; the converter shipped D, because its
reframe negated one output component of an orthonormal basis, which is a
**reflection**, not a rotation. A mirror preserves every bond length, every
angle and the render, so the specs were committed, reviewed and rendered before
a signed-volume check found it. Keep the basis right-handed (`e3 = e1 × e2`),
flip the *axis* rather than the output, and let `chirality:'L'` assert it.

**`Skel` has no general chirality model.** All-equatorial works only because it
is expressible as a geometric rule ("pick the slot most perpendicular to the
ring axis"). A sugar needing a *specific* mixed pattern — galactose differs from
glucose at one carbon — must come from a real record, not from a face-naming
convention invented on the spot.

### 1.4 Adding a molecule: how much fidelity does it owe?

Fidelity is not a global dial. Every geometry bug this project has shipped had
the same shape — the spec was right about everything **except the one feature the
lesson depended on**. The carboxyl C=O was buried inside its spheres; the
α-carbon was drawn linear; the glucose ring was a different sugar. So before
adding a molecule, ask what claim it is making, and classify it:

**Tier 1 — Prop.** Appears in a scene, never compared against a sibling. Water in
a membrane diagram, methane as "the nonpolar one". Hand-write it; correct shape
and polarity is enough.

**Tier 2 — Contrast.** Shown *against* a near-identical molecule where one
feature is the entire point. That feature must be exactly right **and asserted by
`check-molecules.js`**. Most of the AP Bio curriculum lives here:

<!-- ENUM: flip the Built column when a pair ships; add a row for a new contrast. -->
| Contrast | Differs by | The lesson | Built |
|---|---|---|---|
| starch vs cellulose | α- vs β-1,4 linkage | why we can't digest wood | ✓ `glycosidic` |
| saturated vs unsaturated fat | one C=C, *cis* | why butter is solid and oil is not | ✓ `cis` |
| ribose vs deoxyribose | one –OH at 2′ | why DNA is the stable archive | ✓ `stereo:{faces}` |
| glucose vs galactose | one –OH orientation | why galactosemia is a disease | ✓ `stereo:{axial}` |
| L- vs D-amino acids | handedness | why life is homochiral | ✓ `chirality` |
| purine vs pyrimidine | two rings vs one | why A–T and G–C are equal width | ✓ `topology` |

All six pairs are `contrast-lab.html`. L-/D-alanine needed no new
assertion type to join them — `chirality` was already generic over both hands
(`actual = vol>0?'L':'D'`), since it exists to catch a reflection slipping into
an L-only build, not to assume the answer is always L. D-alanine is that spec's
coordinates mirrored (one component negated), same trick a bad SDF converter
would produce by accident.

Saturated/unsaturated fat needed a genuinely new declaration — `cis:{atoms:
[i,j,k,l], value}` — because a cis and a trans double bond share the same C=C
length and the same ~120° flanking angles; only the torsion about the C=C
differs, and nothing above that check could see it. `palmitoleate`'s bend was
worked out by hand (a same-side vs. alternating turn at the two sp2 vertices)
and verified against the dihedral formula before being baked in as literals —
the same process as a `VIEW` tuning pass, just for a whole spec instead of an
orientation.

Starch vs cellulose was the last row, and it shipped the way rule 2 below says
it had to: with a **new assertion type**, `glycosidic:`, added in the same commit
as the molecules. It was never blocked on geometry — it was blocked on being
checkable.

Two things about how it shipped are worth keeping:

**It is rendered as `maltose` and `cellobiose`, not as starch and cellulose** —
rule 1. Coil-versus-ribbon is an *emergent* property of hundreds of repeats
(§6's discipline applied to a polymer), and two rings do not earn the polymer's
name. What the pair does render exactly is the linkage, which is the entire
lesson: maltose is starch's repeat, cellobiose is cellulose's.

**Both share one linkage conformation, deliberately.** A disaccharide's φ/ψ are
floppy, so per §1.6 the pose is a schematic and is *not* asserted — which makes
it a knob, and a knob tuned per-molecule would put part of the visible difference
outside the chemistry. So one slot-and-spin pair is used for both. Each alone
would sit roomier; sharing means every difference on screen traces back to the
one axial/equatorial choice at C1.

**A pose can satisfy every check and still be unpresentable, and that is a
geometry bug, not a camera one.** The shared pose was first chosen for maximum
clearance, which left the two ring planes near *perpendicular*. Every check
passed — no overlaps, correct configuration — and no viewing angle exists that
shows both rings as chairs from one camera, so the second residue rendered as a
blob and several rounds of tuning `VIEW.disaccharide` could not fix it. It is
now swept for **near-coplanar ring planes** (0.87 of parallel), which is also the
extended shape the real disaccharides take; clearance drops to 0.64, still far
above the checker's floor of 0. The general rule: for a multi-ring spec,
*presentability is a property of the conformation*, and the checker cannot see
it — §1.5's "no page may mix families" has the same shape. Reach for the view
table only once the geometry admits a good view.

**How a distinguishing feature gets declared.** One of these goes on the spec,
and `check-molecules.js` fails if the geometry disagrees:

<!-- ENUM: a new claim type goes here AND in check-molecules.js's header, same commit. -->
| Declaration | Means | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `stereo:'all-equatorial'` | every ring substituent equatorial | glucose |
| `stereo:{axial:[i,…]}` | exactly these ring atoms are axial, all others equatorial | galactose (C4) |
| `stereo:{faces:{i:'a',…}}` | which ring atoms' substituents share a face — checked as a *relative* pattern, since the ring normal's sign is arbitrary | ribose, deoxyribose |
| `topology:{rings:[…],fused:true}` | ring count, ring sizes, and that a bicycle shares an edge | purine, pyrimidine |
| `chirality:'L'` | signed volume over CIP priorities | the amino acids |
| `cis:{atoms:[i,j,k,l],value}` | i-j-k-l dihedral about the j-k (C=C) bond is ~0° if `value` is true, ~180° if false | palmitoleate |
| `glycosidic:{anomeric,bridge,partner,config,link}` | the bridging O joins the anomeric carbon of one ring to carbon 4 of *another* ring, and the bond leaving the anomeric carbon is axial (`'alpha'`) or equatorial (`'beta'`) | maltose, cellobiose |

`{faces}` deliberately cannot catch a *global* mirror (flip every substituent and
the relative pattern is unchanged, so L-ribose would pass as D-). No page makes a
D/L claim about a sugar yet; the moment one does, that claim needs its own
assertion rather than leaning on this one.

Every one of those is a stereochemistry or bond-order claim — the class that
renders beautifully while being wrong.

**Tier 3 — Subject.** The structure *is* the lesson (DNA's helix, an enzyme's
active site). Derive it from a real record.

Rules that follow:

1. **Name honesty.** If the distinguishing feature is not rendered correctly,
   do not use the name that implies it. Call it "a sugar", not "glucose".
2. **A claim ships with its assertion, in the same commit.** `stereo:` exists so
   a chemical claim fails a check rather than relying on someone noticing. A new
   claim type means extending `check-molecules.js` as part of adding the
   molecule — never as a follow-up.
3. **Source it by the three-way rule above** (hand-write / PubChem / `Skel`).
4. **Anything a lab manipulates needs an index map** (`pep`, `gly`), because
   reactions address atoms by position and a reindex silently breaks them.

### 1.5 Bond-length scale families — a page may only show one

Display radii in `PALETTE` are stylised and **large**, so no spec can use true
ångströms: a bond must exceed the sum of its two atoms' radii or the spheres
swallow the stick. `check-molecules.js` enforces exactly that, and nothing more.

*How* a spec satisfies it is not uniform across this project, and that is the
trap. There are two families:

<!-- ENUM: update when a spec is added, or SCALE / the GL constants change. -->
| Family | Specs | Rule | Implied scale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. hand-written** | water, ethanol, ammonia, methane, CO₂, carbonic, bicarbonate, hydronium | each length picked to clear its own radii | ~1.2–1.6×, **varies within a molecule** |
| **B. derived** | amino acids, palmitate, AMP, glucose + all glycolysis intermediates, every contrast-pair spec (incl. the two disaccharides) | real Å × one global `SCALE` | **1.9×**, relative lengths truthful |

Family A cannot be normalised, and should not be. `water-lab.html` and
`molecule-lab.html` hard-code `HL=1.55` and tune the whole solvation engine
around that scale — `EQ`, `MIN`, `hbThreshold`, the ice lattice `iceBond`.
Rescaling water means re-tuning that physics for no visible gain, because
nothing ever shows water beside an amino acid.

**The invariant: one page, one family.** Only family B is comparable
molecule-to-molecule, so only family B may make a size claim.

Learned the expensive way, and it is the §1.4 failure shape exactly. `Skel`'s
table (`GL`) was family A while the amino acids were family B; every page drew
from one family, so nothing showed it — until `macromolecule-lab.html` put
`Skel` glucose beside PubChem alanine under the words *"true relative size"* and
glucose came out ~0.7× everything around it. No bond-length check, no angle and
no screenshot of any *existing* page could have caught it. `GL` is now family B,
and the fix also split `GL.CC`/`GL.CO` (C–O is the shorter bond) and gave C=O
its own `GL.CdO`.

**Known residual, measured:** `ringPyranose()` builds a *regular* hexagon, so a
pyranose's ring C–O comes out as long as its ring C–C. Against the real PubChem
β-D-glucopyranose record that leaves the ring 3.13 Å wide vs 2.90, and the
heavy-atom span 6.78 Å vs 6.26 — **+8%**, inherited from the ring and consistent
throughout. Left alone deliberately; closing it means a ring builder with
alternating bond lengths, which is a rewrite, not a constant.

**Do not measure size across hydrogens — heavy atoms only.** An –OH rotamer is
arbitrary in any static model, so a size figure that depends on one measures the
builder, not the molecule. Macromolecule-lab's first "Å across" readout took the
widest pair over *all* atoms and put glucose at 8.3 Å against a real 6.45: the
widest pair was two hydroxyl *hydrogens*, because `Skel.outwardAt` splays every
free substituent away from the centroid at once and a real molecule's hydroxyls
never all point outward together.

If you add a page that must show a solvation molecule next to a derived one,
that is a new problem — solve it in `molecules.js`, not on the page.

### 1.6 Derive when shape carries the lesson; schematize when topology does

Both are legitimate, and the failure is doing one while claiming the other.

Real coordinates are right when the *shape* is the point — a chair ring, a
tetrahedral centre, a helix. They are **wrong** when the lesson is topology.
A phospholipid's real conformer is floppy and renders as spaghetti; the lesson is
"polar head, nonpolar tails", so build it schematically **on purpose** and say so
in the comment, exactly as the open-chain Fischer-projection intermediates in §1.2
(source 3, `Skel`) are deliberate. Bilayers and polymers additionally need
instancing rather than N built groups, and should be validated at the monomer,
not the assembly.

The declaration vocabulary is in §1.4, and its contrast table now has no unbuilt
rows. The two most recent additions were both cases where the render could not
settle the question: `cis:{atoms,value}` (palmitoleate) and
`glycosidic:{…,config}` (maltose/cellobiose).

## 2. Polarity & charge

- Oxygen is **more electronegative** → it carries the partial negative charge
  (**δ−**); each hydrogen carries partial positive (**δ+**).
- The **dipole points toward oxygen** (the negative end).
- The electron cloud / density is shown **shifted toward O**, never symmetric.
- In `molecule-builder.html` this is drawn three ways at once, all from one
  per-recipe `polar` weight (a stylised electronegativity difference, **not** a
  dipole moment — O–H 1.24 → `1`, N–H 0.84 → `0.7`, C–H 0.35 → `0`): the shared
  pair sits **off-centre toward the core**, each atom gets a **δ−/δ+ badge**, and
  the ligand's cloud **leans back** along its bond. The offset is small on purpose
  — pushed far enough to bury the pair in the core it stops reading as *shared
  unequally* and starts reading as *transferred*, which is the ionic picture.
- **Methane is the control.** `polar: 0` means dead-centre pairs and no badges, so
  "shared" in the water tab and "shared" in the methane tab are visibly not the
  same word.

## 3. Electrons & covalent bonding

- A **covalent bond = a shared pair of electrons** (one from each atom). Show it as
  a pair, not a single dot or a plain stick when the lesson is about electrons.
- Oxygen has **two bonding pairs and two lone pairs** (4 electron domains,
  tetrahedral-ish). Both lone pairs must be shown when depicting O's electrons.
- Bonding pairs sit **closer to O** than to H (electronegativity), consistent with
  the δ−/δ+ story.
- **Double bonds are drawn as two sticks, never one.** A spec's bond entry carries
  an optional third element — the bond order — so `[i,j,2]` renders as a pair of
  thinner cylinders. Every C=O in the library is tagged: CO₂, carbonic acid,
  bicarbonate, the amino-acid carboxyls, and the glycolysis carbonyls.
- **Where the pair is splayed matters.** For a molecule with a neighbouring bond,
  the offset direction is derived from the plane those two bonds define, so both
  sticks read head-on. A **linear** molecule (CO₂) has no such plane, so the
  fallback deliberately offsets *across* the view rather than toward the camera —
  otherwise one stick hides exactly behind the other and a double bond reads as
  single from the default angle.
- **An electron wears its own atom's colour** (`molecule-builder.html`). A shared
  pair therefore shows **one dot of each colour** — two atoms each putting one
  electron in, rather than a bond appearing from nowhere — and ownership needs no
  legend. The cost is that a red dot lands on a red sphere, so every dot carries an
  ink ring; without it the shared pair vanishes into the oxygen at exactly the
  moment it matters.
- **A dative (coordinate) bond is drawn as two dots of the DONOR's colour.** In
  NH₃ + H⁺ → NH₄⁺ nitrogen supplies both electrons and the proton brings none, so
  there is no second colour to show. The proton itself is drawn with **no electron
  dot at all** and a `+`, because that is what a proton is. Once formed, the four
  N–H bonds are identical and the ion carries a **whole +1** — every δ badge comes
  off, since four δ+ would assert partial charges that happen to sum to one.
- **P=O stays a single stick, on purpose.** In phosphate the charge is delocalised
  over the oxygens; doubling one of them would assert a localisation that isn't
  there. Same reasoning as drawing bicarbonate's two bare O's identically.

## 4. Hydrogen bonds

- An H-bond is an **intermolecular** attraction between a **δ+ H of one molecule**
  and a **δ− O (lone pair) of another** — never within the same molecule, never
  H-to-H or O-to-O.
- **Strength:** ~1/20 of a covalent bond. State this ratio; don't draw H-bonds
  with the same weight/style as covalent bonds. Convention here: covalent = solid
  stick, H-bond = **dashed** teal connector.
- **Directionality:** strongest when **O–H···O is close to linear**. Detection and
  forces are weighted by the alignment (dot product of the O–H direction and the
  H···O direction); bent geometries are weaker or rejected.
- **One donor H → at most one H-bond.** Each H forms a single H-bond (to the best
  aligned, nearest acceptor within range), so counts stay physical. A real water
  molecule participates in up to 4 H-bonds total (2 as donor, 2 as acceptor).
- **It is an attractive force.** When a bond forms it must actually *pull* the two
  molecules together toward an **equilibrium O···O distance**, balanced by
  short-range steric (Pauli) repulsion as a hard core. Molecules should latch into
  a cohesive network, not drift through each other. (Distances in `water-lab.html` are
  scene units, not Ångström — the *behavior* is what must be right: attract when
  far, repel when too close, settle at equilibrium.)

## 5. Ice (solid water)

- Freezing produces the **real hexagonal ice (Iₕ) lattice**, built from actual
  crystallography — not a decorative grid:
  - Each oxygen is **tetrahedrally bonded to four others**.
  - Structure is **puckered hexagonal bilayers, ABAB-stacked** (hexagonal, not
    cubic ABCABC).
  - **One hydrogen bridges every O···O** linkage (ice rules: each O donates 2 H,
    accepts 2).
  - Real **O···O ≈ 2.76 Å**; the lattice is **more open than liquid**.
- **Ice is less dense than liquid water → it floats.** The frozen state must
  visibly occupy more volume / be more open than the liquid state. This is the
  whole point of the lesson; never let ice look denser than liquid.
- No atom overlap during the freeze/melt animation — molecules must not pass
  through each other (enforced by collision resolution, see §7).

## 6. Emergent properties must trace back to H-bonding

Every "special property" lesson should visibly connect to hydrogen bonding:

- **Cohesion / surface tension** — H-bonds pull molecules together.
- **Adhesion / capillary action** — narrower tube → higher rise (correct
  direction of the effect).
- **High specific heat / heat of vaporization** — added heat first goes into
  **breaking H-bonds** before molecules speed up / escape. Evaporation happens at
  high energy, not low.
- **Solvent** — polar water surrounds ions in **hydration shells**: δ− O faces
  cations (e.g. Na⁺), δ+ H faces anions (e.g. Cl⁻). Orientation must be correct.

## 7. Physics / simulation integrity

- **No interpenetration.** Spheres representing atoms/molecules must not visibly
  overlap during animation. Use position-based collision resolution or a repulsion
  force with a floor below any attractive equilibrium.
- **Stable integration.** Damp velocities; keep force constants low enough that the
  sim doesn't explode. Sanity-check by measuring max velocity after settling.
- **Equilibrium first.** When both attraction and repulsion act on the same pair,
  set the steric floor *below* the attractive equilibrium so bonded pairs rest at
  the intended distance instead of the two forces fighting.
- **Counts must be believable.** If a readout reports a quantity (e.g. number of
  H-bonds), verify it against the geometry — an 8-molecule cluster showing 100+
  H-bonds is a bug (it was: molecules had collapsed with no repulsion).

## 8. Rendering caveats to remember

- **WebGL ignores line width** — thin `THREE.Line` H-bonds are effectively
  invisible and get occluded. Render bonds that need to be *seen* as thin
  cylinders/tubes, not lines.
- Prefer **real computed coordinates** over hand-placed approximations for any
  crystal/lattice/geometry claim. Where a real record exists, convert it
  (`tools/sdf2spec.js`) instead of eyeballing numbers — the amino acids carried
  impossible bond angles for as long as they were hand-written.
- Keep pedagogical exaggerations (enlarged bonds, spacing for legibility)
  **explicit in comments** so they aren't mistaken for to-scale facts.
- **Mixed conventions are fine, but label them.** The amino acids are real 3D
  conformers; the water/solute and glycolysis specs are still hand-built, flat
  (z=0), and use united-atom methyls (ethanol, and the `Skel` builder's sugars).
  Don't assume a spec's style from its neighbours — check the comment above it.
- A stick only shows if the bond is **longer than the two display radii combined**.
  This is a rendering constraint, not chemistry, and it is why lengths get scaled
  up. `check-molecules.js` is the guard.

---

## 9. Reaction & event animation reference (`fx.js`)

Every "something happened" moment in a simulation is marked by a transient effect.
These live in the shared **`fx.js`** module (same reuse pattern as `molecules.js`)
so every page gets identical visuals. Each page creates one instance bound to its
own scene:

```js
const FXi = FX.create(THREE, root, camera);   // root: group the molecules live in
FXi.spawnRing(pos, color);  FXi.popGlow(g, color);  …
FXi.step();                                    // once per frame, in loop()
```

Effects are stepped off a wall-clock delta (frame-rate independent) and are
**purely cosmetic** — they never feed back into the physics, the H-bond counts,
or the pH readout. `popGlow` scales *relative* to a target's current scale, so it
works on both a molecule Group (rest scale 1) and a bare ion mesh (rest scale =
its radius) without resizing it.

### Guiding principle — intensity tracks the chemistry

The loudness of the effect is proportional to what actually happened. **Bonds
breaking or forming** get the full shockwave-and-sparks treatment; **hydration**
(no bonds broken, identity unchanged) gets only a soft shimmer; a solute where
**nothing happens** stays visually silent. Never dramatize a non-event — an
animation on plain dissolving would imply a reaction that didn't occur, and
methane's *silence* is itself the lesson about nonpolar solutes.

### Effect primitives

<!-- ENUM: update when an fx.js primitive is added or removed. -->
| Function | What it draws | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `spawnRing(pos,color)` | white core flash + double additive shockwave ring + 16-spark burst | bond break/form events |
| `popGlow(g,color)` | emissive flash (2.2×) + springy scale overshoot on a molecule's atoms | a molecule freshly formed / an ion tearing free |
| `settleShimmer(g,color)` | soft emissive breathe in-and-out, **no** scale/ring/sparks | a polar solute locking into its hydration shell |
| `protonHop(from,to,onArrive)` | glowing proton arcing between points with a fading comet trail | the H⁺ transfer of an acid ionization |
| `colorOf(g)` | reads a molecule's first **atom** colour (skips covalent-bond meshes) | tinting an effect to whatever it decorates |

### Per-molecule event → effect → colour

Atom/palette colours are the single source of truth in `molecules.js`
(`MolLib.PALETTE.atoms`); ion effects pull them live via `colorOf`.

<!-- ENUM: update when an effect is wired to a new event. -->
| Molecule | `class` | Event | Effect(s) | Colour(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Water** H₂O | `solvent` | — (the medium; ambient H-bond network) | none | — |
| **Salt** NaCl | `ionic` | water bridges the pair → **dissociation** | `spawnRing` + `popGlow` each ion | ring/Na⁺ violet `#9a3fe0`, Cl⁻ green `#1fa968` |
| **Potassium chloride** KCl | `ionic` | same → **dissociation** | `spawnRing` + `popGlow` each ion | ring/K⁺ blue `#0054c0`, Cl⁻ green `#1fa968` |
| **Ethanol** C₂H₅OH | `polar` | settles into water → hydration toast | `settleShimmer` (in sync with toast) | water-blue `#9fd4ff` |
| **Ammonia** NH₃ | `polar` | settles into water → hydration toast | `settleShimmer` (in sync with toast) | water-blue `#9fd4ff` |
| **Methane** CH₄ | `nonpolar` | squeezed out (no H-bonds) | **none** (silence is the point) | — |
| **Carbon dioxide** CO₂ | `reactive` | **step 1:** CO₂ + H₂O → H₂CO₃ | `spawnRing` at attack site + `popGlow` on new H₂CO₃ | cool blue: ring `#7cc4ff`, glow `#bfe4ff` |
| ↳ **Carbonic acid** H₂CO₃ | `polar`, `product` | **step 2:** H₂CO₃ → HCO₃⁻ + H⁺ | `popGlow` on HCO₃⁻ + `protonHop` acid→water | glow `#ffe4b0`; proton `#ffe08a`, trail `#ffcf6b` |
| ↳ **Bicarbonate** HCO₃⁻ | `ion`, `product` | (formed in step 2) | — (glowed as part of step 2) | `#ffe4b0` |
| ↳ **Hydronium** H₃O⁺ | `ion`, `product` | proton lands on a water | `spawnRing` at landing + `popGlow` on new H₃O⁺ | warm amber: ring `#ffc24d`, glow `#ffd98a` |

### Bonding builder events (`molecule-builder.html`)

Each **bond type finishes in its own visual language**, because the page exists to
say they are different kinds of event. Recolouring one effect for all three would
say the opposite. Every effect is fired at a position the module **asks for** (the
anchor atom, the landing point) — never at the world origin, which is only where
the molecule is in the water tab.

| Bond formed | Event | Effect(s) | Colour(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Covalent** (H₂O, CH₄, NH₃) | the last slot fills | `spawnRing` from the **core atom**, expanding through the molecule — the bond is a thing the whole molecule now has | covalent stone `#b3a892` |
| **Dative** (NH₃ + H⁺ → NH₄⁺) | the proton lands in the lone pair | `spawnRing` from the **donor**, in the **donor's own colour** (it did not come from both atoms) + the donor pair swells 1.34× and settles + amber `settleShimmer` on the new ion | N blue `#3f6ae0`; shimmer amber `#ffc24d` |
| **Ionic** (NaCl, KCl) | the electron lands on the nonmetal | **no ring** — `spawnCore` white flash + `spawnBurst` at the **arrival point on the shell**: one electron arrived at one place, the molecule did not acquire something | white `#ffffff` + the nonmetal's colour |

- The **completion ring is latched to fire once per molecule**, re-armed when the
  lesson reports incomplete — so rebuilding earns it again but a second report of
  the same finished state does not.
- The **electron's own flight** carries the ionic story: sodium's dot detaches,
  arcs the gap over 0.55 s and lands **green**. An electron wears its owner's
  colour, so changing colour mid-flight *is* the sentence "it changed owner".
  Counts flip at the moment of transfer, not on arrival — the callback only runs
  while the frame loop does, and a backgrounded tab must not leave the readout
  stale.
- The **dative flare is deliberately small** (1.34×). A dot that balloons stops
  reading as an electron and starts reading as an effect, and the whole claim is
  that these are the *same two electrons* throughout.

### Colour language

- **Cool blue** (`#7cc4ff` / `#bfe4ff`) — a **water-driven** step: hydration, water
  attacking the carbon.
- **Warm amber** (`#ffc24d` / `#ffd98a` / `#ffe08a`) — **acid / proton** chemistry;
  echoes the amber ion–dipole bond colour and the falling-pH story.
- **Ion palette** (violet / blue / green) — dissociation flares each ion in its own
  identity colour so cation and anion read as distinct.
- **Water-blue** (`#9fd4ff`) — the **hydration shell closing in**; deliberately a
  water colour, not the solute's, because the solute is unchanged.
- The **white core flash** (`#ffffff`) is shared by all `spawnRing` events — the
  neutral white-hot instant before the coloured rings take over.

### Where each is wired

- Dissociation — `checkDissociation()` (at the "pop apart" impulse). Wired in
  **both** `water-lab.html` and `molecule-lab.html`.
- CO₂ chain — `updateReactions()` (step 1 hydration, step 2 ionization) —
  `molecule-lab.html`.
- Solute settle — `updateSolutes()`, at the moment descent ends and the hydration
  toast fires (gated to `class === 'polar'`) — `molecule-lab.html`.
- Peptide bond — `condense()` (`aminoacid-lab.html`): `spawnRing` in the peptide
  colour at the join + `popGlow` on both residues, as a water is released.

New pages: add `<script src="fx.js">`, call `FX.create(THREE, root, camera)` once,
`FXi.step()` in the loop, and call the primitives at your own event sites.

## 10. Module architecture — share the plumbing, not the physics

There is deliberately **no monolithic `engine.js`**. The lessons fall into distinct
paradigms — solvation, molecular assembly, pathways, bonding — that do not share a
simulation core, and pretending otherwise would produce an engine whose every
option exists for exactly one caller.

What *is* extracted is the scaffolding nobody's lesson is about:

| Module | Owns | Deliberately does **not** own |
|---|---|---|
| `molecules.js` | colours, radii, geometry specs | anything that moves |
| `scene.js` | renderer/camera/orbit/lights/resize, `atom`/`bond`/`buildMolecule` | any page's physics |
| `fx.js` | transient event effects | when an event happened |
| `atomkit.js` | how an atom is **drawn** for the bonding lessons | how a bond **forms** |

The test for whether something belongs in a shared module: **would two lessons
disagree about it?** Colours, radii and the look of an electron must not vary
between pages — a student moving from one tab to the next has to read the second
lesson with the vocabulary the first one taught. How a bond forms is exactly what
the lessons are *for*, so it stays local.

The split repeats one level down inside the bonding builder. Water and methane
share `covalent-drag.js` because they are the **same mechanic at two slot counts**
— a recipe. Salt gets `ionic-drag.js` because filling a valence slot and handing
an electron over are **different mechanics**, and expressing the second as a mode
of the first would have meant a flag that turns the lesson off. Rule of thumb:
*same mechanic, different constants* → one file with a recipe; *different
mechanic* → a different file.

The two solvation pages (`water-lab`, `molecule-lab`) keep their **own** molecule
builder — cel outlines, Debug recolour/toon, hydration `userData` — and share only
the scene bootstrap, for the same reason.
