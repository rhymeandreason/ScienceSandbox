/* =====================================================================
 *  check-hb.js — assert what the hemoglobin page claims.
 *
 *  Everything here is a statement the lesson makes out loud, turned into
 *  something that fails the build when it stops being true. A stale bake
 *  is the reason this file exists: the trajectory is committed, the solver
 *  is not frozen, and NOTHING about a mismatch between them is visible
 *  from watching the animation — it just plays a fold the current code
 *  would no longer produce.
 *
 *  Run:  node hemoglobin/tools/check-hb.js            (offline, ~57 s)
 *        node hemoglobin/tools/check-hb.js --quick    (~1 s)
 *
 *  WHAT --quick DROPS, AND WHY IT IS SAFE TO DROP IT SOMETIMES. Two of the
 *  assertions here re-run the unfold — the staleness compare and the
 *  quantisation bound — and that bake is 56 of this file's 57 seconds.
 *  Everything else reads the COMMITTED file and takes about a second.
 *
 *  A stale trajectory can only be produced by a change to the code that
 *  produces it: bake-unfold.js, or folding.js's solver, or ribbon.js's
 *  DSSP. Editing the page, the captions, the quaternary baker or this file
 *  cannot make 2HHB-B.fold.bin disagree with its source, so re-deriving it
 *  to prove it still matches is a minute spent to learn nothing. The
 *  pre-commit hook picks the mode on exactly that basis; a bare run is
 *  always the full one, so nobody gets the cheap answer by accident.

   feeds the same convention icOf-style measurement reads back, and when it
   was inverted the flat chain could not show it: every torsion in an ideal
   extended chain is 180 or 0, and both are their own negatives. A mirrored
