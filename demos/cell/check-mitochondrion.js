/* =============================================================================
 *  cell/check-mitochondrion.js — what the detailed mitochondrion may claim
 * =============================================================================
 *  Node-loadable and dependency-free, like membrane/check-chemiosmosis.js.
 *  It builds no geometry: three.js is not here and the organelle's shape is
 *  the human's to judge in a browser. What it checks is the arithmetic the
 *  component prints and the claims that are one line of source each, both of
 *  which ship looking fine and are wrong in a caption.
 *
 *      node cell/check-mitochondrion.js
 *
 *  1. THE ROTOR'S RATIO IS NOT THE COMPONENT'S. It is read from
 *     membrane/chemiosmosis.js, so a Mitochondrion and a Membrane on one page
 *     cannot disagree about what an ATP costs. The check is that
 *     mitochondrion.js reads it rather than typing one.
 *  2. COMPLEX II IS NOT A DOOR. It is on the crista and in the legend, and no
 *     proton may use it: that is the whole reason FADH₂ yields less than
 *     NADH, and it has to be true of the picture, not just of a card.
 *  3. THE SIZES A PAGE MAY PRINT come from the scene unit, and the
 *     exaggerations from the drawn size over the measured one. A typed factor
 *     is a claim nothing checks.
 *  4. EVERY PART CARRIES ITS OWN WORDS. A generated page has no teaching text
 *     of its own, so an anchor with no card is a callout that says nothing.
