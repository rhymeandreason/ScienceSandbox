/* =============================================================================
 *  cell/mitochondrion.js — one mitochondrion, cut open, membrane by membrane
 * =============================================================================
 *  The organelle when it is the SUBJECT rather than one of five things in a
 *  cut cell. The SAME PICTURE the cut cell's mitochondrion already draws — an
 *  outer membrane, and inside it one continuous inner membrane folded back
 *  and forth — with the resolution that distance was hiding: twice the folds,
 *  the sheet swept as a membrane with an edge rather than as a line, the
 *  electron transport chain on it, and protons making the round trip that
 *  respiration is paid in.
 *
 *      Mitochondrion.create(THREE, root, camera, opts)   the model
 *      Mitochondrion.mount(el, params)                   one box, one handle
 *
 *  LOAD cell/organelles.js FIRST. All the geometry is there, as
 *  `mitochondrionDetail`, beside the `mitochondrion` it is a finer version
 *  of and sharing its fold path: the cut cell swaps the same builder in when
 *  the camera flies to one of its five, and a student must arrive at the
 *  same object rather than at a second drawing of it. What is HERE is
 *  behaviour — the protons, the rotors, the picking, and the words.
 *
 *  WHAT THIS COMPONENT IS FOR is one claim, and it is a claim about topology:
 *  there is ONE space outside the inner membrane — the intermembrane space
 *  and the inside of every fold, joined at the crista junctions — and one
 *  space inside it, the matrix. Protons go out of the matrix at the complexes
 *  and come back through ATP synthase. Everything drawn is in service of
 *  that: the sheet is ONE ribbon of ONE membrane's thickness so nobody can
 *  read the folds as separate compartments, and a crista lumen is drawn as
 *  what it is — the open slot between a fold's two arms, necked at the
 *  junction and continuous with the intermembrane space.
 *
 *  THE MACHINES ARE MEMBRANE'S COLOURS, not this component's. The chain's
 *  blue, the synthase's gold, the porin's grey and the proton all come from
 *  palette.js's `respiration`, which membrane/membrane.js reads too — a
 *  student meets the same gold thing making ATP in both boxes, one rung
 *  apart, and neither file may type one.
 *
 *  IT IS NOT THE PHYSICS, AND REFUSES TO BE. There is no pH here, no
 *  proton-motive force, no fuel and no respiratory control: that is
 *  membrane/membrane.js with `context:'mitochondrion'`, one rung down, where
 *  the arithmetic is checked. What this owns is the ARCHITECTURE the
 *  arithmetic happens in, and the two are meant to be mounted together —
 *  the organelle for where, the membrane for how much. The one number they
 *  share is the rotor's stoichiometry, and it is read from
 *  membrane/chemiosmosis.js rather than typed, so the two boxes cannot
 *  disagree about how many protons an ATP costs.
 *
 *  THE PROTONS ARE COUNTED, NOT SIMULATED. Each drawn proton is one route
 *  through one machine, and `state()` reports the routes that completed.
 *  A drawn proton stands for a great many real ones; nothing here is a
 *  concentration and no page may print one off it.
 *
 *  THE CONTRACT (docs/AddingAComponent.md, docs/Components.md):
 *
 *      params   flow 0..1 (live, glides) · uncoupler (live) ·
 *               cristae (folds; asked for from 4, capped by what fits —
 *               about ten at this size), open 0.3..1, seed (rebuild)
 *      state()  the ledger, the counts, and the sizes that are real
 *      events   frame · hover · pick · turn (one full rotor revolution)
 *      parts    outer · porin · ims · inner · crista · junction · complex ·
 *               synthase · matrix · dna · ribosome · proton. LIBRARY is the
 *               teaching text. NOT ALL OF THEM ARE MESHES: `crista` and
 *               `junction` are places ON the inner membrane, and `ims` and
 *               `matrix` are spaces between things — they carry an anchor and
 *               a card, and no show chip, because hiding a fold would mean
 *               hiding the membrane it is part of.
 *
 *  GLIDES: `flow`. SNAPS: `uncoupler`, and every geometry parameter, which
 *  rebuilds — nothing tweens across a rebuild.
 *
 *  BUDGET, measured on the bench at the default ten folds: 0.06 ms a step,
 *  1 ms a frame, 126k triangles, 17 draw calls. The inner membrane is one
 *  swept mesh however many folds it has, which is why the call count
 *  barely moves with `cristae`. A REBUILD IS 40 TO 60 ms, which is why
 *  `cristae`, `open` and `seed` are rebuild parameters and must not go on a
 *  slider a student drags. The bench does exactly that, and it is a bench.
 *
 *  SCALE. Lengths ALONG the organelle are honest: one scene unit is 100 nm,
 *  so the capsule is 1.9 by 0.7 µm and `state()` may be printed. The
 *  membranes and the machines are not, and SCALE.exag says by how much. A
 *  4 nm bilayer beside a 700 nm organelle is a fifth of a pixel.
