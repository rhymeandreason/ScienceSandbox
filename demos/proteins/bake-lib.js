/* =============================================================================
 *  proteins/bake-lib.js — reading a deposition, for every protein's baker
 * =============================================================================
 *  Node only, offline, no dependencies but `folding/folding.js`. Three bakers
 *  and `tools/bake-trace.js` had grown their own copy of this; two of them were
 *  byte-identical, which is where a rule starts to drift. The rules here are
 *  the ones a drifted copy breaks invisibly:
 *
 *  · A NUCLEIC CHAIN IS DROPPED BY caTrace AND IT SAYS SO. DNA and RNA have
 *    no CA, so a chain of either is skipped atom by atom and never appears in
 *    the result — 1AOI bakes as eight histones and no DNA, and the render
 *    looks fine. `caTrace` now reports what it dropped, unconditionally.
 *  · ONE COPY PER RESIDUE. An altLoc other than blank or 'A' is a second
 *    position for an atom already counted. Two copies of a residue put two
 *    points in the trace and the ribbon splines through both.
 *  · SECONDARY STRUCTURE IS READ, NEVER DETECTED. HELIX and SHEET are the
 *    depositors' assignment; a geometric guess is a claim about the structure
 *    nothing in the repo checks, and on a page about folding it invents the
 *    lesson. A file with no records bakes as all coil and SAYS so in `ssFrom`,
 *    so it draws as a visible worm rather than a silent wrong.
 *  · SS IS INDEXED BY RESIDUE NUMBER, never by position in the array. A chain
 *    with an unmodelled loop slides every letter after the gap onto the wrong
 *    residue otherwise.
 *  · `nums` RIDES ALONG WITH `first`. They are what let a consumer break the
 *    ribbon where the chain breaks; without them an unmodelled loop is drawn
 *    as a smooth band across coordinates nobody measured, which at ribbon
 *    width is indistinguishable from data.
 *  · COORDINATES COME OUT CENTRED, at 0.01 A. A card frames what it is given
 *    and a crystal's origin is nowhere near the molecule.
 *
 *  WHAT IS NOT HERE, and must not move here: which entries a bench shows, what
 *  they claim, and whatever that protein is about — prion's residue overlap,
 *  rnase's ligand and disulfide meta, myoglobin's pocket and its superposition.
 *  This file answers "what does the file say"; a baker answers "what is this
 *  protein for", and the second question is the one with a human in it.
 *
 *  Each baker composes its OWN output object, in its own key order, from
 *  `assemble` and `frameOf`. That is deliberate: the bakes are committed
 *  artefacts and a shared writer would reorder every one of them the day it
 *  changed its mind about a key.
 *
 *  Used by: every `proteins/<name>/tools/prep.js` on the shared pipeline, and
 *  tools/bake-trace.js. `sickle/tools/bake-sickle.js` and
 *  `hemoglobin/tools/bake-hbs.js` take only the superposition below — it was
 *  written in the first of those and moved here once six bakers under
 *  proteins/ were reaching across the repo for it.
 *
 *  ONE BAKER DELIBERATELY DOES NOT USE IT: `hemoglobin/tools/` feeds
 *  hemoglobin-lab's folding trajectory and is a pipeline of its own. That is
 *  the LESSON's haemoglobin and not the collection's — `proteins/hemoglobin/
 *  tools/prep.js` bakes the same two depositions through this file for the
 *  gallery, which is why the registry entry is an ordinary one.
 *
 *  `proteins/prion/tools/` writes traces like the rest now, but through `PrionLib` rather than through
 *  this file — its sources are already cut and aligned to each other by that
 *  library, and re-reading them here would be a second parse of files a
 *  library in the repo already owns. The RULES above still hold there; it is
 *  the code that differs.

 *  what `chainKinds` exists to make visible: it says what every chain in the
 *  file IS, so a baker can refuse rather than quietly halve its subject.
 *
 *  A nucleic residue is anchored by three atoms and they answer different
 *  questions. P is the backbone — where the ribbon goes. C1' is the glycosidic
 *  attachment — where the base hangs off. The base ring atoms give a centroid
 *  and a plane normal, which is what lets a renderer draw a slab that is
 *  actually in the plane of the base rather than a stub pointing at it.
 *
 *  THE FIRST RESIDUE OF A CHAIN HAS NO PHOSPHATE. A 5' terminus is deposited
 *  with O5' and no P, so a P-only backbone silently starts one residue late
 *  and the ribbon is short at one end — small enough to read as the chain
 *  simply ending there. O5' then C5' are the fallbacks, in that order.
 *
 *  PURINE OR PYRIMIDINE IS ASKED OF THE ATOMS, NOT OF A NAME LIST. N9 present

/* WATSON-CRICK PAIRS, SOLVED — and this is the one thing in this file that is

   no BASEPAIR line in a PDB, so a renderer that wants to draw a rung has to
   earn the pair from the coordinates, and the bake says `pairsFrom:'geometry'`
   the way `ssFrom` says where the letters came from.
 *
 *  THE TEST IS THE HYDROGEN BOND ITSELF: purine N1 to pyrimidine N3, which is
 *  the one contact every Watson-Crick pair has and no other arrangement of two
 *  bases reproduces. Distance and coplanarity alone admit stacked neighbours,
 *  which are 3.4 A apart and beautifully parallel.
 *
 *  IT FINDS ONLY WATSON-CRICK, ON PURPOSE. A wobble, a Hoogsteen or tRNA's
 *  tertiary contacts come back unpaired, and unpaired renders as a stub rather
 *  than a rung — so the picture under-claims instead of inventing a ladder.
 */
/* THE H-BOND TOLERANCE A STRUCTURE'S RESOLUTION EARNS.
 *
 *  The Watson-Crick N1...N3 distance is ~2.85 A and essentially invariant —
 *  it is a hydrogen bond, not a variable. What varies is how well the model
 *  knows where the atoms are. 1BNA at 1.9 A has a median of 2.87; 1AOI at
 *  2.8 A has 3.04, with a long tail. A single tight cutoff therefore does not
 *  mean one thing across a collection: it finds every pair in a sharp
 *  structure and drops a fifth of them in a blunt one, and the ladder comes
 *  out looking damaged where the DATA is blunt rather than the DNA.
 *
 *  So the tolerance is derived from the number the file states about itself,
 *  and the bake records what was used. 0.25 A per A beyond 2.0 is a
 *  coordinate-error allowance, not a claim about chemistry.
 *
 *  IT IS ONLY SAFE BECAUSE OF THE C1'-C1' WINDOW BELOW. Loosening a lone
 *  distance test admits stacked neighbours, which sit 3.4 A apart and
 *  beautifully coplanar; a pair's sugars are ~10.5 A apart and a stack's are
 *  ~5, so the two criteria fail on completely different things. */
