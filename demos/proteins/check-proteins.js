 *  happened to prion, where `keeps` listing its two raw files failed every
 *  clone, and `keeps` not listing them failed every checkout that had them.
 *
 *  GIT IS ASKED RATHER THAN .gitignore RE-IMPLEMENTED. The pattern language
 *  has negations, directory rules and precedence, and a second half-copy of
 *  it here would disagree with the real one on the day it mattered.
 *  `check-ignore` also answers for paths that do not exist, which the missing
 *  half of this question needs.
 *
 *  NO GIT, NO EXEMPTION. If the call fails for any reason other than "none of
 *  these matched", every path is treated as tracked and the checks stay as
 *  strict as they were — a checker that quietly stopped checking because a
 *  subprocess failed would be worse than one that is occasionally noisy.
