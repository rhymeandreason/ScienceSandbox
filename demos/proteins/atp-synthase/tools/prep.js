 *  prep.js — ATP synthase: the three catalytic sites, and the machine
 *  they sit in.
 *
 *  Run:  node proteins/atp-synthase/tools/prep.js   (offline, no deps)
 *
 *  UNDER REVIEW. Nothing is in proteins/proteins.js yet, because everything
 *  in that file is a decision and none has been made. The CANDIDATES table
 *  below is what step 4 gets handed; what survives moves into the registry
 *  and this table is deleted in the same commit. `data/candidates.json` is
 *  written from it so the bench has something to read in the meantime, and
 *  it goes away with the table.
 *
 *  THE SUBJECT IS THE ROTATION. Review cut the catalytic-site group from
 *  four views to two: what a reader wants from this enzyme is the motor,
 *  and the two sites that survive are the ones the motor's turn explains —
 *  empty, and still holding the product it has not released. Everything
 *  about the three-state binding change mechanism that the sites used to
 *  carry is now carried by the three rotary states instead, where it is a
 *  measurement rather than an arrangement of buttons.
 *
 *  SEVEN CANDIDATES, THREE GROUPS, and the groups are what the fitting is
 *  organised around:
 *
 *    the sites   open, dp — one beta subunit each, superposed on the P-loop
 *                so the site coincides and the domain swing does not.
 *    the machine human, state2, state3 — the whole human enzyme in three
 *                rotary positions, superposed on the stator so the rotor is
 *                what moves.
 *    alone       head (the bovine F1 assembly) and ring (one c11 rotor),
 *                each in its own frame, each answering a question the
 *                other two groups cannot.
 *
 *  FIT ON WHAT THE VIEW IS ABOUT, twice, and both are the interesting
 *  decision rather than a default:
 *
 *    · THE FOUR SITES FIT ON THE P-LOOP, residues 156-163, backbone atoms
 *      only. Not on the beta subunit's Ca trace, and the difference is the
 *      whole picture: beta-E is open because its C-terminal domain has
 *      swung away from the nucleotide, so a whole-chain fit splits the
 *      difference and misaligns the site in every view to make the domains
 *      agree. Fitting the eight residues that grip the phosphates puts the
 *      chemistry in one place and lets the swing be visible.
 *    · THE THREE STATES FIT ON THE HEAD, chains A-F, by chain and residue
 *      number. The alpha3beta3 hexamer is the part that does not turn, so
 *      aligning it is what makes the rotor's third-of-a-turn legible as
 *      rotation instead of as three unrelated boxes. The residual is
 *      printed: if these three already shared a frame it would come back
 *      near zero, and the panel should say so rather than implying a fit
 *      did work it did not do.
 *
 *  NOTHING HERE IS AN ANIMATION AND THE BAKER CANNOT MAKE ONE. Every file
 *  is a still. The turn between the states is inference from kinetics, and
 *  the bench says so in words rather than tweening between them.
 *
 *  THE HUMAN STRUCTURES ARE mmCIF AND THERE IS NO .pdb, which is what
 *  `proteins/cif-lib.js` was written for: 28 chains and 39,000 atoms is
 *  past what the legacy format holds, so RCSB publishes one and 404s the
 *  other. The conversion is records-only and `proteins/bake-lib.js` reads
 *  the result, so the altloc rule and the read-never-detected rule are the
 *  same ones every other protein in the repo gets.
 *
 *  SOURCES, for a re-run from scratch. ~30 MB raw against the ~700 KB
 *  baked here, and data/src/ is gitignored:
 *
 *    cd proteins/atp-synthase/data/src
 *    for id in 1BMF 1H8E 2WGM; do
 *      curl -O https://files.rcsb.org/download/$id.pdb; done

/* ---- the turn ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  THE ROTATION THE BENCH SPINS, measured rather than chosen. The rotor is a
 *  rigid body — fitting one state's c-ring onto another leaves a residual of
 *  0.8 A over 600 Ca — so the motion between two states is one rotation about
 *  one axis, and a page can show it by turning the rotor of a SINGLE file
 *  rather than by blending three. Every frame of that spin is then an exact
 *  rigid rotation of deposited coordinates; only the angle in between is
 *  interpolated, which for a rigid body on a fixed axis is the least a
 *  picture can invent.
 *
 *  THE ANGLE IS READ OFF GAMMA, NOT OFF THE c-RING. The ring is eight
 *  near-identical subunits, so the rotation carrying one state's ring onto
 *  another's is only defined to the nearest 45 degrees — measured there it
 *  gives whole numbers of subunits (2, 5) and rounds the real angle away.
 *  Gamma is a single copy and breaks that symmetry: it fits at 0.58 A over
 *  271 Ca, and the angles come back 121.4 and -107.2 degrees. Those are about
 *  120 apart, which is the catalytic three-step, and 120 degrees is 2.67
 *  c-subunits — so the ring cannot stop where the head wants it to, and the
 *  shaft absorbs the difference. The rounded ring figures hid exactly that.
 *
 *  A RIGID MOTION IS A SCREW, AND THE AXIS HAS A POSITION AS WELL AS A
 *  DIRECTION. This is the trap that cost a rebuild: the direction came out of
 *  the c-ring-to-head vector and agreed with the measured one to cos 1.000,
 *  which made it look settled — but the LINE was then assumed to pass through
 *  the c-ring centroid, and it does not. It passes about 85 A away, and
 *  spinning about the wrong line swung the rotor around the outside of the
 *  molecule instead of turning it: a rotor 24 A from where the next state
 *  actually has it, having started 20 A away. So the line is solved from the
 *  transform, by asking which points the rotation leaves on themselves.
 *
 *  Returns the motion taking `from` ONTO `to` — the direction the page needs,
 *  since it spins state 1 towards the others. Fitting the other way round and
 *  reusing the angle is the same trap wearing a different hat: it turns the
 *  rotor backwards, and a rotary motor running the wrong way is a claim about
 *  the enzyme rather than a rendering detail.

    /* DOES THE SHARED AXIS ACTUALLY REPRODUCE THE OTHER STATES? Each state was
       solved on gamma alone and then averaged into one axis, so this asks the
       question the averaging raises: spin state 1's WHOLE rotor by the shared
       angle and measure how far it lands from where that experiment put it.
       It is the only number here that validates the picture rather than
       describing it, and it is what the page prints — 26 A of separation
       becoming 2 is the claim, and it is checkable.

       It also catches the trap that cost a rebuild. The first version of this
       spun about an assumed line and this figure came back WORSE than the
       unspun distance, which is a thing no amount of looking at the render
       would have told anybody. */
