/* =============================================================================
 *  proteins/proteins.js — every protein in proteins/, and what we have of it
 * =============================================================================
 *  What `molecules.js` is to a spec, this is to a deposition: the one place
 *  that says which structures we hold, which variant is the default, and what
 *  each one is FOR. It is read by three kinds of reader — the bakers under
 *  `proteins/<name>/tools/`, the benches, and `proteins/check-proteins.js` —
 *  and it is written by two authors, which is the thing to understand before
 *  editing it.
 *
 *  TWO HALVES PER VARIANT, WITH DIFFERENT OWNERS.
 *
 *    said   everything outside `read` — purpose, species, which chains,
 *           which residues make the pocket. A HUMAN's, and a re-bake never
 *           touches it.
 *    read   inside `read: {}` — method, chains in the file, residues
 *           modelled, residues declared, and the file that was written. THE
 *           BAKER's, rewritten from the deposition on every run.
 *
 *  That split is why a card can print "x-ray diffraction, 151 of 151
 *  residues" without a human ever typing a number that a re-bake could
 *  falsify.
 *
 *  EVERY `read` FIELD IS ALSO IN THE BAKE — that is the invariant the whole
 *  file rests on. These five are convenience lines printed into an INDEX, so
 *  the collection can be listed, sorted and compared without opening
 *  seventeen files; they are never a fact the bake cannot produce. The moment
 *  one is, the index stops being a copy and becomes a second source, and the
 *  second source is the one that goes stale. `check-proteins.js` re-derives
 *  all five from the baked file and fails on a disagreement — including the
 *  case where the bake cannot answer at all, which is the way this could
 *  otherwise be broken quietly.
 *
 *  It is why the prion baker carries EXPDTA, REMARK 2 and the COMPND chain
 *  list into every reduced PDB it writes: a cut-down file that cannot say
 *  which experiment made it, how sharp it is and how many chains its entry
 *  has is a file this index would have to REMEMBER things for.
 *
 *  Everything else a reader wants about one structure — resolution, ligands,
 *  the fit residual, the extents — stays in that structure's own bake, beside
 *  the coordinates it describes, and a bench reads it from there.
 *
 *  NO PAGE COPY HERE EITHER. What a structure IS belongs in this file; what a
 *  bench SAYS about it under one particular stage is page copy and lives on
 *  the page, in its `SAYS` table.
 *
 *  `proteins/tools/registry-io.js` is the one place that knows how to splice a
 *  `read` block back in. It runs this file rather than parsing it, the same way
 *  `tools/mapcontent-io.js` handles the door map, so the prose and the comments
 *  around the data cannot be lost to a save — and in this file the comments are
 *  the reasons a structure was chosen, and which one it was chosen instead of.
 *
 *  METHOD IS A CONTROLLED VOCABULARY, and the reason is not tidiness:
 *
 *    'x-ray diffraction' · 'solution nmr' · 'electron microscopy' ·
 *    'neutron diffraction'          — MEASURED
 *    'predicted'                    — MODELLED, by AlphaFold or its like
 *
 *  A predicted structure is a different kind of claim from a measured one, and
 *  a collection that lets the two read alike will eventually show a student a
 *  guess as a fact. This is the field that keeps them apart, which is why it
 *  is spelled one way — `check-proteins.js` fails a method outside the list,
 *  so 'X-RAY DIFFRACTION' and 'x-ray' cannot both end up here and split the
 *  collection in two on a sort.
 *
 *  What QUALIFIES a method — a resolution for a measured structure, a pLDDT
 *  for a predicted one — is a fact about that one structure and lives in its
 *  bake, not here. The index says which KIND of claim a variant is; the bake
 *  says how good it is.
 *
 *  URLS ARE DERIVED FROM `source`, never stored — `rcsb.org/structure/<id>`
 *  and `files.rcsb.org/download/<id>.pdb` for a `kind:'rcsb'`, and a different
 *  pair for AlphaFold. A stored URL is one more thing to mistype, and every
 *  bench already builds both from the id for exactly that reason.
 *
 *  WHAT IS NOT HERE. The sickle fibre, whose baker feeds hemoglobin-lab's
 *  folding trajectory and which this file's re-bake does not reach. It joins
 *  the day someone gives it a `pipeline` that does. Hemoglobin itself is in,
 *  on `pipeline:'own'` for that same reason — its entry says why.
 * ============================================================================= */

     WHAT WAS LOOKED AT AND NOT SELECTED: 1TRZ, the T3R3 hexamer. It carries

     ribbon it read as a second copy of the dimer. It is the entry to come back
     for if a lesson ever wants the DRUG rather than the hormone.

     Mg2+ clamps onto that carbamate. 8RUC deposits it as KCX and declares it
     in MODRES; 1RCX has a plain lysine there and no magnesium in the file, so
     the difference between the two entries is a residue name a checker can
     read.

     KCX IS A HETATM, which is why the baker passes `Bake.modResidues` to the
     trace. Without it the activated chain bakes with a hole exactly where the
     subject is, and the ribbon splines smoothly over it.

     THE CO2 THAT ACTIVATES IS NOT THE CO2 THAT GETS FIXED. They arrive at the
     same site and they are different molecules, which no single structure can
     show — a lesson has to say it, and neither of these files can.

     1RCX's ASYMMETRIC UNIT IS ALREADY THE BIOLOGICAL ASSEMBLY: sixteen chains,

  /* WHAT THE PROTEIN DOES, in one word the collection can be sorted on. A
     vocabulary rather than free text for the same reason `method` is one:
     'enzyme' and 'an enzyme' would split the group in two on a filter and
     nobody would see it happen.

     `unknown` is a real answer and not a gap to fill in later. PrP is the
     case — what its healthy form is FOR has been argued for forty years —
     and a collection that guessed would be teaching one side of that.

     `structural` is the answer for a protein whose job is to HOLD, and it is
     not a synonym for 'no function': collagen does one thing, mechanically,
     and does it as material rather than as chemistry. It is the first entry
     here that catalyses nothing and carries nothing. */
  /* `hormone` is the answer for a protein whose whole job is to be RECOGNISED
     somewhere else. Insulin catalyses nothing, carries nothing and holds
     nothing up; what it does is arrive at a receptor and be read. That is a
     different kind of answer from the other four, and it is the word the
     wishlist reserved for insulin before insulin was pulled. */
  /* `storage` is the answer for a protein whose job is to HOLD SOMETHING that
     would be dangerous loose. Ferritin catalyses a step on the way in and
     still is not an enzyme in this collection's sense: what it is for is the
     iron sitting inside it afterwards. */
  /* `recognition` is the answer for a protein whose job is to BIND ONE THING
     and be found holding it. An antibody catalyses nothing, carries nothing
     and holds nothing up; what it does is grip a shape it was selected for
     and present the fact of that grip to the rest of the immune system. It is
     the mirror of `hormone` — insulin's job is to BE recognised, an
     antibody's is to DO the recognising — and the word the wishlist reserved

  /* HOW A VARIANT DIFFERS FROM THE HEALTHY PROTEIN, where it differs at all.
     Optional: most variants are the same protein under different conditions —
     a ligand bound, a second species, a solution instead of a crystal — and
     they carry no `state` because there is nothing to say. The field is for
     the collection's other axis, the one the prion pair opened and the sickle
     tetramer, the OI peptide and RNase's two swaps were each recording in
     prose of their own.

     It answers HOW the difference arises, which is the part a reader cannot
     see in a ribbon:

       healthy  the unaffected form, in an entry that also holds an affected
                one. Not a default: it is a claim that something else here is
                the disease, and 1QLZ and 2HHB are the two that make it.
       disease  the pathological form, reached with NO change of sequence —
                the same chain folded another way. PrP is the case, and the
                only one: 6LNI is 1QLZ's sequence, refolded.
       mutant   the pathological or altered form, reached BY a substitution.
                2HBS is one glutamate for one valine; 1CAG is one glycine for
                one alanine. Both are diseases, and both are diseases of the
                SEQUENCE, which is what separates them from PrP.
       swap     the same sequence and the same fold, with a domain traded
                between two chains. RNase's two, and neither is a disease —
                it is how a fold comes apart, which is the reason they are
                held beside the prion.

     A sort on this field puts the two routes to a disease structure side by
     side, and that contrast is the entire reason the prion entry and the
     haemoglobin entry are in one collection. */
