 *  Iron to whatever is bound, and how far the iron sits out of the porphyrin
 *  plane. Both are MEASURED off the baked pocket rather than quoted, because
 *  every printed number on a myoglobin page has to be one a re-bake could
 *  change.
 *
 *  IT IS SHARED BECAUSE TWO PAGES PRINT THE SAME NUMBER. The bench
 *  (myoglobin-test.html) and the student page (myoglobin.html) both say how
 *  far the CO in 1ABS has moved off the iron, and two implementations of that
 *  is two answers waiting to disagree in front of a reader.
 *
 *  Needs nothing. Takes a parsed trace bake with a `pocket`.
