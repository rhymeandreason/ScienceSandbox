 *  proteins/check-nucleic-acids.js — the nucleic index against the bakes
 * =============================================================================
 *    node proteins/check-nucleic-acids.js
 *
 *  `check-proteins.js` for `nucleic-acids.js`, and it exists for the same
 *  reason: the index is a CONVENIENCE COPY, and the moment one of its numbers
 *  is a thing the bake cannot produce it has become a second source — and the
 *  second source is the one that goes stale. So every `read` field is
 *  re-derived here from the baked file and compared.
 *
 *  IT ALSO CATCHES THE ORPHAN, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS WRITTEN. `check-proteins.js`
 *  walks `PROTEINS` and only ever looks inside a registered folder, so before
 *  this file existed `proteins/dna/`, `proteins/trna/` and `proteins/zif268/`
 *  each held a bake that no index named and no checker read. Nothing was
 *  failing; nothing was looking.
 *
 *  Two files can drift where one cannot, which is the cost of the split — so
 *  this asserts the same four things its sibling does:
 *
 *    · every variant has a bake, and every bake has a variant
 *    · the method, chain count and residue/nucleotide counts agree
 *    · the pair, wobble and modified counts agree
 *    · a `kind` is one of the three, and matches what the bake contains
 *
 *  Offline, no dependencies. Gated on `proteins/nucleic-acids.js` and on the
 *  bakes themselves in .githooks/pre-commit.
