/* =============================================================================
 *  proteins/nucleic-acids.js — every deposited structure here that carries DNA
 *  or RNA, and what we have of it
 * =============================================================================
 *  `proteins.js` is to a protein trace what this is to a nucleic one. Same
 *  discipline, same two authors per variant, same invariant: every `read`
 *  field is one the BAKE can produce, so nothing here is a number a human
 *  typed and a re-bake could falsify. `check-nucleic-acids.js` re-derives all
 *  of them and fails on a disagreement.
 *
 *  WHY A SECOND FILE RATHER THAN A `polymer` FIELD ON THE FIRST. `proteins.js`
 *  opens by saying it is every protein in `proteins/`, and widening it would
 *  have meant an implicit `polymer:'protein'` on seventeen existing entries,
 *  an `ec` that is absent-and-odd rather than optional, and a checker
 *  branching on every assertion. The cost of two files is that they can drift;
 *  the cost of one was touching every entry in it to add something none of
 *  them needed.
 *
 *  THE LINE BETWEEN THE TWO FILES IS THE BAKE, NOT THE BIOLOGY: a structure
 *  is indexed here when its bake carries nucleic chains. Zif268 is a protein
 *  and it is in this file, because 1ZAA's bake is the mixed shape — `pairs`,
 *  `kind` per chain, a `zinc` array — and `check-proteins.js` cannot read one.
 *  Drawing the line at "is it a protein" instead would put one entry in the
 *  protein index whose bake the protein checker has to special-case, which is
 *  the thing having two files was supposed to avoid.
 *
 *  WHAT A `kind` MEANS HERE, and it is about the FILE rather than the molecule:
 *
 *    dna       a duplex and nothing else
 *    rna       one chain, folded, no protein
 *    complex   protein and nucleic acid in one deposition, one frame
 *
 *  Read by the benches under `proteins/<name>/` and by
 *  `check-nucleic-acids.js`. The bakers do not read it — each one owns its own
 *  entry choices, the same split `proteins.js` makes.
