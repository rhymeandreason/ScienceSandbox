/* =============================================================================
 *  sickle/hbcrowd.js — a crowd of haemoglobins, and what HbS does that HbA does not
 * =============================================================================
 *  Classic script after lib/scene.js, kit/surface.js, kit/card-stage.js and
 *  sickle/sickle-fibre.js. Exposes window.HbCrowd on the component contract.
 *
 *      const A = HbCrowd.mount(elL, { variant: 'HbA' });               // tumble
 *      const S = HbCrowd.mount(elR, { variant: 'HbS', stick: true });  // assemble
 *      S.play();            // switch the attraction on and let go
 *
 *  ONE QUESTION: why does the mutant molecule make a fibre and the normal one
 *  not. sickle-fibre.js draws the fibre as a finished object; this draws the
 *  MOMENT it forms, and it is a SIMULATION, not an animation. Nothing here
 *  knows how long assembly should take, which molecule goes next, or where the
 *  strand will end up. Two runs are not the same run.
 *
 *  ---- THE ONLY RULE ------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Every molecule carries the same sticky patch and the same pocket for it, and
 *  every molecule attracts every other through them. When a pair drifts close
 *  enough, and lands near enough to the angle the crystal measured, it SNAPS to
 *  exactly that angle and the two become one body. That is the whole model.
 *  Chains, ends, growth from the middle, joins between chains that formed apart
 *  — none of it is coded. It falls out.
 *
 *  ONE BOND, NOT TWO. The double strand looks like two operations, a lateral
 *  pair and an axial repeat. It is one: `pair` applied twice IS the axial
 *  repeat, to half an ångström and 1.26° (the 2₁ screw the crystal is built
 *  on). So a molecule has exactly two sites, `pair` and its inverse, an
 *  assembly is a run of consecutive powers of it, and what a page calls
 *  repeat i is power 2i. check-fibre.js asserts the identity, because this
 *  whole component is built on it.
 *
 *  ---- WHY IT WAITS -------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  A bond can also BREAK, and how likely that is falls off sharply with how big
 *  the body holding it has got: a dimer is gone in a moment, a hexamer usually
 *  survives, past ten it effectively never lets go. So small aggregates form
 *  and die, over and over, until one gets over the hump — and then it only
 *  grows. That is nucleation, it is the reason deoxygenated HbS sits liquid for
 *  seconds before a fibre appears, and it is the reason a red cell usually
 *  clears the capillary before it stiffens.
 *
 *  IT IS ALSO WHY THE DELAY IS DIFFERENT EVERY TIME. Nothing schedules it.
 *  A page that needs to say something when assembly starts should listen for
 *  `nucleate`, not set a timer.
 *
 *  HbA RUNS THE SAME PHYSICS WITH THE ATTRACTION AT ZERO. That is the claim the
 *  lesson makes about the mutation, so it is the only difference in the code.
 *
 *  ---- MEASURED AND NOT --------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *    MEASURED   the tetramer (an SES over a deposited structure), and the bond:
 *               SickleFibre's `pair`, read from sickle/data/fibre.json, the
 *               same operation that component builds the whole fibre from. A
 *               snapped contact is the crystal's, exactly, not a spring at rest.
 *    NOT        the rates. Real haemoglobin at 5 mM reorients in nanoseconds
 *               and the real delay is seconds to minutes; this is a crowd at a
 *               walking pace so a reader can follow one molecule. The walk is
 *               Brownian in SHAPE — a persistent random walk with no net
 *               current — and state() reports no speed, because none of these
 *               numbers is one.
 *    NOT        the twist. These strands are straight. The 14-strand fibre's
 *               pitch is an EM result, not this crystal's, and a lesson about
 *               the first contact has no business showing it.
 *
 *  ---- PARAMS ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *    variant  'HbA' | 'HbS'   which surface, and which colour the β6 mark takes
 *    n        a CAP on the crowd (rebuild, snaps). The room is sized to the
 *             frame and filled at a fixed density, so leaving this alone is
 *             normal; lowering it thins the crowd out for a bench
 *    grow     how big the biggest assembly must get before `done` fires. The
 *             simulation does not stop there; the page usually moves on
 *    stick    whether the attraction is on at all. play() turns it on
 *    drift    rms speed of a lone molecule's walk, scene units per second
 *    base     path prefix to demos/ from the page ('' at the top level)
 *
 *  THE β6 MARK IS THE ONLY COLOUR THAT CHANGES BETWEEN VARIANTS. HbS paints it
 *  the fibre's patch orange (SickleFibre.COLOURS.patch); HbA paints it the
 *  site's charge blue, read from the `--cold` token so the caption that calls
 *  glutamate charged and the spot it names cannot drift. Both β chains carry
 *  the mark on both variants: in the crystal only one of the two is ever in a
 *  contact, but a free molecule has not chosen yet.
 *
 *  Anchors for note(): patch · chain. Events: nucleate · bond · done · load.

     It is a SLAB one molecule deep. Real cytoplasm is crowded in all three,
     and in all three you would see nothing: the chain would form behind a wall
     of haemoglobin. A monolayer is the compromise every textbook diagram of

     Ornstein-Uhlenbeck: velocity dragged toward zero over TAU and kicked at

     as a monomer and turns much less — which is why a chain, once it exists,

     REACH is how far the patch pulls, and it is generous on purpose: the real

     the neighbours, or molecules would fly to a chain across the room, so it
     is held under two diameters. SNAP_D / SNAP_C are how close a pair must
     come to the crystal's own pose before it is taken as made.

     A BIG BODY IS A BETTER TARGET, by GRIP per molecule it holds. Not a
     fudge to make the lesson finish: an end held rigid by ten neighbours does
     not wander off while a monomer is lining up on it, and the alignment two
     free molecules must both pay for, a monomer joining a chain pays once.
     It is why polymerisation is slow to start and then quick — the same
     asymmetry the breaking rate has, from the same cause. */

  /* ---- HOW BIG A MOLECULE IS TO ANOTHER MOLECULE ---------------------------
     Not one sphere. A tetramer is four subunits and its own bond proves that:
     at the contact the crystal measured, the two β subunits sit 33 Å apart,
     closer than any single sphere that would also stop two molecules sliding
     through each other. So the excluded volume is FOUR spheres on the four
     subunit centroids, read off the surface bake at load, and SUB_R is what
     covers the skin without swallowing it.

     And it relaxes, but only for the one pair that is lining up on the bond,
     and only as they line up. That is what a binding interface IS: proteins
     interdigitate where they are complementary and nowhere else, so a pair in
     the right pose may come to the crystal's distance while the same pair
     turned any other way cannot. It is the lock and the key, and without it
     the attraction has to fight the repulsion through a wall it can never
     open — nothing assembles at all.

     WHAT RELAXES IS THE DISTANCE, NOT THE FORCE. Softening the force instead
     is what let a hard pull drag a pair clean through each other: a weak wall
     is still a wall you can be pushed past. So the wall stays as stiff as it
     ever was and only its floor moves, from two subunit radii down to the
     closest the crystal's own contact puts two subunits — which means an
     aligned pair can reach the bond and nothing, aligned or not, can go one
     ångström past it. */
