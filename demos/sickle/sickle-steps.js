/* =============================================================================
 *  sickle/sickle-steps.js — sickle cell, as steps for the shell
 * =============================================================================
 *  Content only: what each step says and what it asks the stage to do through
 *  ctx. sickle-lab.html wires it, and its header says what ctx carries.
 *
 *  FIVE BEATS, ONE ARGUMENT: one base, one amino acid, one contact, one cell,
 *  one blocked vessel.
 *
 *      1  cell      BloodCell, whole — the toggle sickles it; the codon card
 *      2  protein   Proteinbox, skin — the two β6 spots, the toggle swaps HbA/HbS
 *      3  split     HbCrowd ×2 — opens on one molecule and widens into the
 *                   crowd; then the HbS side's attraction goes on and chains
 *                   assemble themselves
 *      4  split     BloodCell ×2, cut open — the same fibres, a scale up
 *      5  split     BloodFlow ×2 — discs slip through, crescents catch and jam
 *
 *  Beats 3 to 5 have no panel. Two halves, one caption, Next. The toggle that
 *  drives 1 and 2 sits at the bottom of the room, the same place on both, and
 *  carries one state (ctx.variant) across them.
 *
 *  THE COPY IS SHORT ON PURPOSE. Each beat makes one claim and the scene makes
 *  it; the words say what to look at. Nothing here prints a residue count, a
 *  distance or a rate — the components carry those in state() for a page that
 *  wants them, and this one does not.
 *
 *  Exposes window.SickleSteps.
