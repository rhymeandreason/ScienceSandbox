/* =============================================================================
 *  sickle/sickle-fibre.js — the HbS fibre: one contact, a double strand, a rope
 * =============================================================================
 *  Classic script after lib/scene.js, kit/tube.js, kit/surface.js and
 *  kit/card-stage.js. Exposes window.SickleFibre.
 *
 *      const F = SickleFibre.mount(el, { base:'sickle/', preset:'contact' });
 *      F.set({ preset:'fibre' });   F.state();   F.destroy();
 *
 *  ONE ASSEMBLY, THREE SIZES OF THE SAME OBJECT. `preset` is how many copies
 *  are drawn and nothing else — the geometry and every transform are identical
 *  across all three, so the fibre is visibly the same thing as the contact seen
 *  further away, and a lesson stepping from one to the next is not switching
 *  models mid-argument.
 *
 *      contact   1 repeat,  1 double strand   the beta6 -> pocket pair
 *      strand    n repeats, 1 double strand   the same contact, repeating
 *      fibre     n repeats, 7 double strands  the rope
 *
 *  ---- MEASURED AND MODELLED, AND WHICH IS WHICH -----------------------------
 *
 *  Everything here comes from one of two places, and `state()` reports them in
 *  separate blocks so a page cannot print one as the other.
 *
 *    MEASURED, from hemoglobin/data/2HBS.pdb via sickle/tools/bake-fibre.js
 *      · the tetramer itself
 *      · the LATERAL operation: the rigid motion putting the second tetramer of
 *        the asymmetric unit beside the first (rmsd 0.32 A over 574 Ca, so the
 *        two really are the same molecule twice)
 *      · the AXIAL repeat: the crystallographic a translation, 63.344 A
 *      · both beta6 -> Phe85/Leu88 contacts that justify calling those the
 *        strand-forming operations at all
 *
 *    MODELLED, from the electron-microscopy literature and NOT checkable here
 *      · that seven double strands make a fibre
 *      · the core/sheath radii they sit at
 *      · the helical pitch of the whole assembly
 *
 *  The modelled three are PARAMETERS, deliberately. A number a page can move
 *  says "someone chose this" in a way a constant does not, and none of them can
 *  be verified against anything in this repository. If a fibre EM
 *  reconstruction is ever committed here they should become measurements and
 *  this paragraph should shrink.
 *
 *  WHAT IS DELIBERATELY MISSING: the strands are not all equivalent in the real
 *  structure — inner core and outer sheath differ in their contacts, and the
 *  outer strands are thought to be less regular. Drawing all seven double
 *  strands as copies of one measured double strand is a simplification, and a
 *  visible one at high repeat counts, where the sheath looks more crystalline
 *  than the real fibre is.
 *
 *  ---- PARAMS ---------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *    preset    'contact' | 'strand' | 'fibre'   sets repeats and strands
 *    repeats   1..30   copies along one strand          REBUILDS, so it snaps
 *    strands   1..7    double strands                   REBUILDS, so it snaps
 *    rep       'tube' | 'surface'                       snaps
 *    colour    'strand' | 'chain'                       snaps
 *    marks     true | false   the contact sites          snaps
 *    core      A   radius of the two core strands       glides
 *    sheath    A   radius of the sheath ring            glides
 *    pitch     A   helical pitch of the whole fibre     glides
 *    base      path prefix to sickle/ from the page
 *
 *  The three that glide are placements: every instance is re-seated, nothing is
 *  rebuilt. The rest change how many instances exist or what geometry they
 *  carry, and nothing can tween across that.
 *
 *  ---- WHAT IT REFUSES TO OWN ------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Any claim about the cell. A fibre is `macromolecule` rung and a red cell is
 *  `cell`; they may not share a camera, so "the fibre deforms the cell" is a
 *  handoff to bloodcell/ and never a camera move. It is not a `down` either —
 *  that is for zooming IN, and this one goes out.

     the patch and the pocket stick together BECAUSE both are greasy and water
     will not have either of them.

  /* HALF OF THESE SITES DO NOTHING, and the marks used to hide that.

     Every tetramer has two beta chains, so drawing a patch and a pocket on each
     gives four dots. The crystal only ever uses two: a full lattice scan (both
     P2(1) operations across +-1 cell in all directions, in bake-fibre.js) finds
     exactly two beta6 -> Phe85/Leu88 contacts, and chain D donates while chain B
     receives. Chain B's beta6 and chain D's pocket are never in contact.

     Four equal dots implied all four were working, which quietly contradicts the
     reason this assembly is a STRAND: one way in and one way out per molecule
     gives a line, two of each would branch. So the idle pair is drawn small and
     washed out — present, because a spare site is a real feature, but visibly
     not in play.

     Which is which comes from the bake's per-chain `donates` / `receives`
     flags, so it is measured rather than a pair of chain letters typed here.

     CAVEAT this cannot resolve: "idle" is true of the CRYSTAL. Whether the
     fibre uses that spare beta6 in contacts BETWEEN double strands is exactly
     the part 2HBS does not contain. */

     Placing tetramer i at rotY(i*dtheta) . translate(i*a) is a SCREW, and the
     useful property of a screw is that the relation between any two consecutive
     bodies is the same rigid motion — so the twist does not progressively tear
     the strand apart; it applies one uniform strain to every contact along it.
     check-fibre.js asserts exactly that, because it is the sentence that makes
     ONE strain number meaningful for a whole strand.

     But the strain is real, and it grows with radius and with twist rate. At the
     commonly-cited 3000 A pitch it stretches the sheath's beta6-to-pocket link
     by about 3.6 A, on a contact whose deposited side-chain distance is 4.1. A
     real fibre absorbs that by deforming its molecules; rigid copies of a
     crystal strand cannot, so the number is reported rather than hidden. Above
     about 2 A it is fair to say the picture has stopped being a model of
     anything.
