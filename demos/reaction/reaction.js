/* =============================================================
 *  reaction/reaction.js — WHAT A STEP DOES TO A MOLECULE
 * =============================================================
 *
 * Extracted from `glycolysis-lab.html`, which had eight animation verbs
 * (`in out ox move lose split open iso`) as a hand-written if/else chain in
 * the page, twice: once for the whole-step route and once for the per-lane
 * one. The two had already drifted — step 6's hydride was shed on one route
 * and not the other, which is a hydrogen that flies to NAD⁺ while a copy of
 * itself stays on the aldehyde. The comment admitting it ("SHED HERE TOO.
 * This route never did") is why this file exists.
 *
 * THE STRUCTURAL CLAIM, and the reason the duplication is now impossible:
 * **every verb except `split` is a per-lane body.** A reaction happens to a
 * molecule; the lanes are how many molecules it is happening to. So there is
 * one body per verb, `lane(c)`, and the whole-step route is "run it on each
 * lane". `split` is the exception because it is the one event that is ABOUT
 * the lane count — one molecule becomes two — so it owns the whole stage and
 * its own completion.
 *
 * WHAT THIS OWNS
 *   · the verb table, and `verb()` so a lesson can add one
 *   · the transfers a reaction is made of: a group flying between molecules,
 *     a free molecule arriving out of solution, a proton hopping, a fragment
 *     assembling out of what left and drifting off frame
 *   · spec geometry: where an atom of a built OR not-yet-built molecule is in
 *     world space, and which atoms a phosphoryl transfer moves
 *   · the ± badge, and the name that rides a molecule that never lands
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT OWN, and must not (SCIENCE.md §6): lanes, carriers, the
 * tray, the ledger, `done`/`busy`, or any lesson's arithmetic. Those reach it
 * through `host`, and every one of them is a question about the STAGE, never
 * about the chemistry. If a verb needs a new host entry to know what reacted,
 * the verb is wrong.
 *
 * TIMINGS ARE THE MODULE'S, overridable per page via `host.timing`. They are
 * not arbitrary: each is a reading decision argued at its definition below,
 * and glycolysis's values are the ones they were tuned to.
 *
 * Loads after `kit/leaving.js`, `kit/motion.js`, `kit/molgraph.js`, `fx.js`
 * and `atomkit.js`. Checked by `reaction/check-reaction.js`.

   *      proton is the only H in the air; it arrives on a carbon the product
   *      draws one on. Hop without shed leaves the white H sitting where it
   *      was while a second one flies off it, and the honest question is where
   *      the extra came from.
   *   2. THE C=O SLIDES OUT to the carbon the H left. Ringed where it forms.
   *   3. THE MOLECULE TURNS OVER. This is not chemistry and must not look like
   *      it — no ring, no glow, slow and eased. But it cannot be skipped: a
   *      ketose and its aldose are drawn from opposite ends of the parent, so
   *      swapping one for the other teleports the phosphate the whole length
   *      of the molecule and says the phosphate moved. It does not — the
   *      NUMBERING flips, C1 of a ketose being C3 of the aldose. A proper
   *      rotation, so it cannot mint an enantiomer: the new stereocentre is
   *      made by beat 1, not by this.
   *
   * AND IT CHANGES MOLECULES HALFWAY THROUGH THE TURN. The swap has to happen
   * somewhere and every choice shows a seam: the carbons superimpose exactly
   * under the flip but the phosphate does not — the two specs grow it into
   * different rotamers about a free rotor, which means nothing chemically.
   * Swapping at either END of the turn shows that as the phosphate twitching,
   * on the one step whose point is that the phosphate does not move. At the
   * halfway point the molecule is EDGE-ON — foreshortened to a line, so a
   * rotamer's worth of depth is the least visible it will ever be, and the eye
   * is tracking a turn besides. One continuous turn, two molecules, and the

 *  writing an adapter twice is the module asking its question at the wrong
 *  altitude, not the page being repetitive. This answers the stage half from the

 *  overrides only what is chemistry:

 *        ...Reaction.stageHost({lanes:LANES, carriers:CAR, onLanes}),
 *        carrierPoint, carrierBond, donorSpec, freeSpec, … });
 *

 *  stage event with a lesson consequence: both pages re-solve their camera fit
 *  on it, and each solves a different one. This fires it and says nothing about
 *  what it should do.
 *
 *  WHAT THIS MUST NEVER GROW: an answer that depends on which step is running,
