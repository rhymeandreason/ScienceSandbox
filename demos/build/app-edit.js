/* =============================================================================
 *  build/app-edit.js — the text editor, running inside the app's own sandbox
 * =============================================================================
 *  Loaded on demand by the relay in `apps-client.js` when the builder turns
 *  the mode on, and never otherwise: an app being read costs nothing for a
 *  feature only its editor uses. It runs on the app's opaque origin, so it
 *  can reach the app's DOM and nothing of the builder's.
 *
 *  A TEXT IS EDITABLE IF IT ROUND-TRIPS TO THE SOURCE, and that test is the
 *  whole design. Every word a generated page shows is a JS string literal in
 *  its source — `eyebrow`, `title`, the `body` HTML, a `stat-label` inside a
 *  `ctx.ui.controls` template. Find the node's text in the source exactly
 *  once and the edit is a `{find, replace}` pair, which is the format the
 *  builder already applies. Find it zero times or twice and the node is not
 *  editable, no pencil, no caret: it is offered for SELECTION instead, and
 *  goes to the model as a reference on the next request.
 *
 *  The test refuses the right things without being told to. A readout painted
 *  from data each frame (`netEl.textContent = s.net`) is not in the source, so
 *  it cannot be typed over — which is the rule CLAUDE.md states about numbers
 *  in user-facing text, arrived at from the other end. A callout's label comes
 *  from the component's own library, so it selects rather than edits.
 *
 *  WHAT MAKES A REPLACEMENT SAFE is the context of the match, read from where
 *  it landed rather than guessed. Inside a `<script>` the text sits in a
 *  string literal, so a quote, a backslash or a `${` has to be escaped; all
 *  three quote characters are escaped whatever the literal's own delimiter is,
 *  since `\"` inside a single-quoted string is a legal identity escape and
 *  knowing the delimiter would mean lexing the script. Where the enclosing
 *  literal holds markup — `body`, a `controls` template — the text is going
 *  through innerHTML, so `<`, `>` and `&` become entities; where it does not,
 *  it is going through textContent and a typed `<` must stay a `<`. The
 *  server syntax-checks the spliced page before it stores it, so a case this
 *  gets wrong is a rejected save and not a broken app.
 *
 *  CLICKS STILL DO WHAT THE PAGE DOES. Editing does not take the page over:
 *  a click on outlined text edits or selects it, but text inside a control (a
 *  Next button, a tab) keeps its own click and offers a badge instead, so the
 *  student can walk the steps and edit each one's copy without leaving.
