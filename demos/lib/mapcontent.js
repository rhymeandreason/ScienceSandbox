/* =====================================================================
 *  mapcontent.js — the door map's content, and nothing that draws it.
 *  Loaded as a classic script BEFORE tests/question-composer.html's own
 *  script;
 *  exposes window.MapContent = { DOORS, CONCEPTS, QUESTIONS, CONTENT,
 *  PLACEMENTS }.
 *
 *  This is CONTENT, not code: no behaviour, no DOM, nothing to call.
 *  It is split out of the page so it can be edited somewhere better
 *  than an HTML file — map-cms.html reads and writes it through the dev
 *  server's /api/mapcontent, the same path questions-cms.html uses.
 *
 *  CONCEPT, NOT MODULE. A node here used to be called a module, which
 *  collided head-on with the code modules in lib/ and with Modules.md: two
 *  unrelated things, one word, in a repo that names both constantly. A node
 *  on this map is a CONCEPT — one claim, worth one card.
 *
 *  NOT lib/questions.js. That bank cuts the same ground into 27 COARSE
 *  buckets ('water', 'bonds', 'shape'); this cuts it into the concepts a
 *  lesson actually teaches ('polarity', 'hbond', 'ice', 'heat'), which is the
 *  decomposition the map needs and the reason the two are separate files
 *  rather than one. 54 of the question texts started life there.
 *
 *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  DOORS — a door is a question big enough to hold a region. `tint` is the
 *  door's colour on the map, and every concept wears its own door's — which
 *  is how a crossing is visible on a card that looks like all the rest. `open` says
 *  whether it has been written; the others are named because concepts
 *  point at them, and they are what a second door costs: content, not a
 *  code change.
 *
 *  CONCEPTS — one claim each, and `host` is the page that teaches it.
 *  `alt` is the OTHER WORDS a reader might type for this card, ` · `
 *  separated, and it exists because a name is not the only way in: nobody
 *  types "Simple diffusion", they type "diffusion", and "buffer" is what a
 *  student asks for when the card is called Acids & pH. It replaced matching
 *  the reader's words against the ID, which only worked where somebody had
 *  happened to pick a short one — `ice` and `geometry` landed, `cooperat` and
 *  `hydrophob` were truncations nobody would ever type, and `condense`
 *  answered for Dehydration & hydrolysis by accident. An alternate is
 *  authored, so it says what it is.
 *
 *  `alt` is for KNOWING, not for ranking. It is matched exactly (after the
 *  composer's `norm`) and is deliberately NOT baked into the claim's vector:
 *  a sentence that measured well is not improved by having synonyms stapled
 *  to it, and a two-word row embedded against a corpus of sentences ranks
 *  badly. Two alternates must not normalise to the same text — first match
 *  wins and which card it is would be an accident of table order — and the
 *  checker fails on it.
 *  `rank` is its place in ITS door's fan, so a door opens on its rank 1
 *  concepts and not on all nine. `state` is CLAUDE.md's vocabulary
 *  (built / engine / planned) and `away` marks a concept belonging to
 *  another door, which the map dots in a different colour so a crossing
 *  is visible.
 *
 *  QUESTIONS — one row each, and QUESTION-MAJOR on purpose:
 *
 *      ['Why is water bent and CO₂ straight?', { polarity:1, geometry:1 }]
 *        the question                            the concepts, and the rank
 *                                                the question has ON EACH
 *
 *  The map crosses from one concept to another THROUGH a shared question,
 *  so a question is one node however many concepts name it. Written
 *  concept-major, the same question appeared once per concept and a
 *  re-wording in one of them silently split that node in two — breaking
 *  the exact thing the map exists to do. One row cannot drift from
 *  itself.
 *
 *  RANK belongs to the EDGE, not to the question: 27 of these carry a
 *  different rank on different concepts, because rank answers "is this a
 *  good FIRST thing to ask on this card?" and the answer changes with
 *  the card. 1 introduces from cold, 2 follows up, 3 is depth.
 *
 *  A question naming ONE concept is a caption, not a crossing — it costs a
 *  node and leads nowhere. 28 of these are still that, which is where the
 *  editorial work is.
 *
 *  CONTENT and PLACEMENTS — the units a concept can show, and where each
 *  one sits. Content-major and split in two for the same reason QUESTIONS is
 *  question-major: the thing is one object however many concepts point at it.
 *  Their own headers, below, carry the rest.

  /* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   *  CONTENT — the units a concept can SHOW. A concept is a claim; content is
   *  a thing that makes the claim visible, and one concept can have many. That
   *  is why this is content-major with a placement table beside it rather than
   *  a map keyed by concept: `VIEWS` was concept-keyed and could hold exactly
   *  one entry per card, so glycolysis could have a molecule or a video and
   *  never both.
   *
   *  `id` is namespaced by kind so nothing collides with a concept id, and so
   *  a placement row says what it is placing:
   *
   *      w: water sim   b: builder   m: molbox
   *      r: protein drawn ON a concept card   p: a protein SPECIMEN
   *      l: lesson      v: video
   *
   *  HOW A KIND IS PLACED IS THE KIND'S OWN BUSINESS, and the three ways are
   *  not interchangeable:
   *
   *    INLINE  (water, build, molbox, r-protein) mounts a live 3D box in the
   *            concept card's thumb. It costs a WebGL context, browsers cap
   *            those near 8-16, so the page rations them — a card takes the
   *            rank 1 inline item and no more.
   *    BUTTON  (lesson) is an opener under the thumb. A lesson has no still of
   *            its own worth showing; the card it hangs off is the picture.
   *    CARD    (video, p-protein) is its OWN node on the map, hanging off the
   *            concepts that placed it, the way a specimen already did. A video
   *            has a poster, a running time and someone else's name on it —
   *            that is a card's worth of content, not a chip in a corner.
   *
   *  A concept with no inline content grows no picture box at all: a stand-in
   *  that is not that concept's own subject is worse than no picture.
   *
   *  The water scenarios' `frame` blocks are TUNING rather than curriculum —
   *  they are what water/watersim.js's step() takes.
   *
   *  A VIDEO is somebody else's work. `credit` is not decoration and is
   *  printed on the card: `src` is a YouTube id, and the page builds a
   *  youtube-nocookie embed from it so an unopened card makes no third-party
   *  request. `poster` is a LOCAL still for the same reason: a remote
   *  thumbnail would put the map's resting state on someone else's server and
   *  break the card the day the video moves.
   *
   *  `captions` names a local file of `{ tracks: [{ id, label, source,
   *  cues: [{ t, text, step }] }] }`. It is authored rather than fetched:
   *  YouTube publishes no caption text a page can read (the Data API's
   *  captions.download is owner-only, and timedtext serves nothing to a plain
   *  request), and the only track on the glycolysis video is auto-generated
   *  ASR, which renders enzyme names as noise.
   *
   *  A video that is not ours leads with ITS OWN words, credited. A second
   *  track carrying the same beats for a Bio 101 reader is a summary and is
   *  labelled as one. Which is showing is a fact the column prints, because a
   *  column of somebody else's writing with no name on it reads as ours.

   *  PLACEMENTS — WHERE a unit of content sits, and nothing else. One row per
   *  content item, carrying the rank it has on each concept that shows it:
   *
   *      ['v:glycolysis', { glycolysis:1 }]
   *        the content       the concepts, and the rank it has ON EACH
   *
   *  RANK MEANS WHAT IT MEANS EVERYWHERE ELSE ON THIS MAP: 1 is what the card
   *  opens with, 2 is one step in. Reusing it rather than inventing a rule is
   *  what lets content be authored like everything else here. For inline
   *  content it also breaks the tie — a card mounts its rank 1 item, since it
   *  can only afford one live box.
   *
   *  PROTEINS ARE THE EXCEPTION THAT PROVES THE TABLE. A `p:` row places a
   *  protein whose entry lives in proteins/proteins.js, and nothing here
   *  restates what that protein IS. Every entry in that registry is drawn
   *  whether or not it has a row here; without one it hangs off the Proteins
   *  door at the back rank, which is the honest place for a structure nobody
   *  has filed yet. So adding a protein stays a one-file edit, and this table
   *  is an override rather than a second registry to keep in step.
   *
   *  A third element picks a protein VARIANT by its id in that protein's
   *  entry; omitted, the registry's own default is drawn. Which deposition a
   *  card shows is the MAP's decision — 2HHB or sickle 2HBS is a different
   *  claim — and the paths behind it are the registry's, which
   *  kit/proteinbox.js reads for itself.
   *
   *  A specimen and a video are both LEAVES: they hang off concepts and off
   *  questions and never off each other, which is what keeps the map layered.
   *
   *  PLACEHOLDER CONTENT. Which specimen belongs under which concept, and at
   *  what rank, is the same editorial judgement as every other rank here.
   *  The six protein rows are a starting guess, not a decision.
