/* =====================================================================
 *  molecules.js — shared molecule library + colour palette
 *  Loaded as a classic script (Three r128 global style) BEFORE the page's
 *  main script. Exposes window.MolLib for both water-lab.html and the
 *  upcoming molecule-builder.html, so colours and geometry stay identical
 *  across pages.
 *
 *  PALETTE is the single source of truth for atom + bond colours.
 *  MOLECULES will hold the declarative specs (geometry + charge sites +
 *  solute class) that drive buildMolecule() and the solvation physics.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  BOND LENGTHS — one hard rule, and check-molecules.js enforces it: a bond
 *  must be longer than the sum of its two atoms' display radii, or the spheres
 *  swallow the stick and the molecule renders as a blob. Display radii here are
 *  stylised and LARGE, so no spec may carry true ångströms at render time.
 *
 *  Every spec in lib/ STORES real ångströms (`units:'angstrom'`) and register()
 *  multiplies by SCALE once on the way in, so relative lengths are truthful and
 *  every molecule in the library is comparable to every other. One scale
 *  family: there is no longer a second set to keep off the same screen.
 *
 *  A small molecule beside a big one is mol-small.js — water, ammonia, methane,
 *  O₂, CO₂, ethanol, carbonic acid, from measured lengths.
 *
 *  The salts carry no coordinates, only dissociation records, so nacl/kcl are
 *  scale-free. watersim.js keeps the one it dissolves in its own SALTS table.

  //              register() scales them once — see the note at the top.

  //              donor = a δ+ H that can point into water; acceptor = a

  //  PROVENANCE — `src:` on every spec (docs/molecule-pipeline.md item 1)
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  //  Four different paths produce geometry in this file and, until this field
  //  existed, nothing in a spec recorded which one it took. Two of them
  //  ('pubchem' and 'skel') even produce the same bond-length family, so they
  //  are indistinguishable by inspection while failing in completely different
  //  ways. `src.path` is the discriminator:
  //
  //    'hand'    — coordinates typed by a person, each bond length chosen to
  //                clear its two display radii. Family A. Its own source.
  //    'pubchem' — a real measured 3D record through one of the converters in
  //                tools/. Family B. The ONLY path that cannot be re-run from
  //                this repo alone (no .sdf is committed yet — item 2).
  //    'skel'    — constructed at load time from idealised VSEPR angles by the
  //                Skel builder below. Family B. Fully reproducible, because
  //                the code IS the source. Defaulted by Skel.prototype.spec,
  //                so a new Skel molecule is labelled without anyone deciding.
  //    'built'   — constructed, but from literals worked out once by hand
  //                rather than by Skel. Family B. Reproducible only in the
  //                sense that the comment above the spec explains the
  //                construction; nothing re-derives it.
  //    'mirror'  — reflected from another spec in this file at load time.
  //
  //  THE THREE-VALUE RULE, which is the point of the field:
  //
  //    a field PRESENT   — this decision was made, and here it is.
  //    a field NULL      — this decision was never pinned. Regenerating may
  //                        silently produce a different molecule.
  //    a field ABSENT    — not applicable to this path.
  //
  //  `conformer:null` is therefore a claim, not a gap: it says the sweep in
  //  molecule-pipeline.md item 0 applies to this spec — a CID alone does not
  //  identify a conformer, so anything with a rotatable side chain may come
  //  back different. Do not "tidy" a null into an absence.
  //
  //  Fields for path 'pubchem': `cid` or `query` (how the record was asked
  //  for — a bare NAME is weaker than a CID and is recorded as such, because
  //  a name pins neither a stereocentre nor a CHARGE STATE; see `amp` for what
  //  that one cost), `record` (the record_type), `conformer`
  //  (PUBCHEM_CONFORMER_ID), `tool` (which converter), `sdf` (the committed
  //  input in tools/sdf/), `regen` (below), `reindex` if the fixed backbone
  //  order was imposed by hand, `strip`/`charge` for post-processing,
  //  `fetched` when the date is known.
  //
  //  `regen` — HOW COMPLETELY the committed .sdf rebuilds this spec. A recorded
  //  verdict from a real run, not something re-derived at load:
  //    'exact'  — the .sdf regenerates these coordinates to 0.000.
  //    'manual' — the .sdf is the true source, but a hand step sits in the
  //               middle, so it does not rebuild on its own [proline].
  //    'lost'   — NO published record reproduces this spec any more. The
  //               committed .sdf is the closest available, NOT a reproduction,
  //               and THE SPEC IS NOW THE SOURCE. Refreshing one of these from
  //               PubChem silently swaps a conformer [glutamine, glutamate].
  //  tools/sdf/README.md has the per-file table and the two cautionary cases.
  // The derived-family scale factor. It lives HERE rather than in skel.js
  // because it is a property of the library, not of the builder: the PubChem
  // converters apply the same 1.9 (tools/sdf2spec.js), so monomer pages that
  // never load a builder still need it. skel.js reads it back off MolLib to
  // define GL and AR. Exported so Stage.measure() can divide it out and report
  // real ångströms — pages used to hard-code 1.9, which silently becomes wrong
  // the day this constant moves.
  const SCALE = 1.9;

  // Presentation views: which way a molecule should FACE, in radians [x,y,z],
  // applied by Stage.buildMolecule rather than baked into the coordinates. A
  // spec's atom positions stay canonical, so check-molecules.js measures the
  // molecule and not a camera angle, and two specs can share one view by name
  // instead of by copying three constants and a comment.

   * `spec.atoms[i].pos` directly and compare it against PALETTE.radii, which
   * are scene units. Scaling at render would leave every one of those
   * comparing ångströms to scene units — a class of bug that renders as
   * "everything is suddenly tiny" in some places and not others.
   *
   * `units:'scene'` means the numbers are already display-scale and must NOT
   * be touched. Only specs DERIVED from an already-registered spec carry it
   * (dAlanine mirrors alanine), since those are scaled already.

   * Scaling is idempotent: a spec is stamped once and never re-scaled, so a
   * double registration cannot silently double a molecule's size.
