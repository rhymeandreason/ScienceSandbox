/* =============================================================================
 *  lib/site.js — the chrome every page shares, in one file
 * =============================================================================
 *  Loaded absolutely, once, by every public page:
 *
 *      <script defer src="/demos/lib/site.js"></script>
 *
 *  Absolute because a featured page sets <base href="/demos/"> and a protein
 *  bench sits three folders down; a relative src resolves differently in each.
 *
 *  It owns what is true of the whole site and nothing about any one page:
 *  analytics, the four links in the top bar, and the right-hand half of the
 *  document shell's foot. Anything site-wide added later belongs here rather
 *  than in 30 files.
 *
 *  Only body.kodo gets a foot. A lesson on body.lshell-page is a full-window
 *  scene with no bottom edge to hang one from, and Design.md forbids a second
 *  masthead over it; the privacy notice is reached from the homepage and the
 *  collection pages instead.
 *
 *  A page whose foot is entirely its own writes data-own on it and is skipped.
