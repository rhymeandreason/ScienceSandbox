/* =====================================================================
 *  annotate.js — callouts pinned to a point on a 3D model.
 *
 *  A label with a leader dot that names part of a molecule: "Iron (Fe) —
 *  binds O2", "Heme group". The callout every textbook figure has.
 *
 *  WHAT THIS OWNS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT (SCIENCE.md 6). It owns how a
 *  callout LOOKS and how it TRACKS: the dot, the leader, the type, the
 *  three reveal modes, the projection maths. It owns nothing about what a
 *  callout says or where it points — that is the lesson, and it stays in
 *  the page. The test the section sets is "would two lessons disagree
 *  about it?", and the answer here splits cleanly: a student must not have
 *  to learn a second annotation vocabulary on the second tab, and no two
 *  pages will ever want to label the same atom.
 *
 *  ---- ANCHORS ARE SEMANTIC, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT ------------------
 *
 *  `at` may be a fixed point, but it is meant to be a FUNCTION returning
 *  one, and every moving model should pass a function. The label then
 *  follows whatever the page recomputes each frame — a folding chain, a
 *  sliding subunit, a heme riding its chain in — because the anchor is
 *  "wherever atom N is now" rather than a position captured at build time.
 *
 *  An anchor may also declare which way its part FACES, and a note on a part
 *  turned away from the camera fades out: a callout on the underside of a leaf,
 *  read from above, points at a surface the student is looking at the back of.
 *  `facing` is a direction in the MODEL's own space and is transformed each
 *  frame, for the same reason the point is — the model turns.
 *
 *  NEVER capture the point at build time. Baking an anchor — a coordinate,
 *  or a spot on the mesh — is what a viewer has to do when it is handed an
 *  opaque asset, and it is wrong here: every model on this site is built
 *  from named atoms that move, so a baked point comes adrift the moment
 *  the thing it names does anything.
 *
 *  ---- DOM, NOT SPRITES ------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  The labels are absolutely-positioned HTML over the canvas, not textures
 *  in the scene. A canvas sprite bakes whatever font is loaded at draw
 *  time — atomkit.js carries a whole comment about redrawing once the
 *  webfonts settle — and it resamples badly as the camera pulls in. DOM
 *  gets the house type from sandbox.css for free, stays crisp at every
 *  zoom, and can be read by a screen reader. The cost is that the layer
 *  cannot be occluded by geometry, which is not a cost: a label
 *  half-swallowed by the atom it names reads as a rendering fault. These
 *  are annotation OVER the scene, deliberately.
 *
 *  Labels are still depth-SORTED against each other by z-index, so two
 *  callouts that overlap stack the way the model does.
 *
 *  ---- THE THREE TRAPS -------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  1. step() BELONGS IN THE RENDER LOOP, not in whatever advances your
 *     animation. Orbiting and zooming move the camera without advancing
 *     anything, and a label that only updates when the model does shears
 *     off its atom the moment the user drags. Same rule as
 *     hemoglobin-lab's pearls, for the same reason.
 *
 *  2. THE LAYER MUST NOT EAT THE MOUSE. It covers the whole stage, so it
 *     is pointer-events:none, and only the dots turn pointer events back
 *     on — and only in 'click' mode. Get this wrong and orbit dies with no
 *     visible cause, because the thing swallowing the drag is invisible.
 *
 *  3. PROJECT IN CSS PIXELS. camera.project gives normalised coordinates;
 *     turning those into a position means the element's CSS box
 *     (clientWidth/Height), never canvas.width/height, which on a retina
 *     screen is twice that and puts every label off the bottom right.
 *
 *  ---- REVEAL MODES ----------------------------------------------------
 *
 *    'on'      every label visible. The figure-caption mode.
 *    'click'   dots only; clicking one opens its label, clicking again
 *              closes it. For a crowded model where all-on is soup.
 *    'reveal'  play() runs them in as a staggered wipe, left to right
 *              across the screen, each one rising into place. For a page
 *              that wants the naming to be an EVENT — the same sweep
 *              hemoglobin-lab uses for its residue pearls, so the two read
 *              as the same gesture.
 *
 *  The mode is a property of the layer and can be changed at any time.
 *  'reveal' finishes in the 'on' state: the wipe is how the labels ARRIVE,
 *  not a state they stay in.
 *
 *  ---- POINTING AT CHROME, NOT AT THE MODEL ----------------------------
 *
 *  `atPx` is the escape hatch: a function returning [x, y] in CSS pixels
 *  within the stage, used INSTEAD of `at`. It exists for the one honest
 *  case — naming a CONTROL, a button or a toggle that is part of what the
 *  student is being taught rather than part of the model. membrane-lab's
 *  pump step points at its own Spend 1 ATP button, because "one ATP buys
 *  one turn" is a fact about the transaction the button performs.
 *
 *  Use it for nothing else. A callout on a fixed screen position is a
 *  caption with a leader line drawn on it, and it comes adrift from the
 *  chemistry the moment the camera moves — which is the exact failure the
 *  semantic-anchor rule above exists to prevent. If the thing you are
 *  naming is IN the scene, it has an atom, and the atom is the anchor.
 *
 *  A pixel-anchored note is never depth-sorted (there is no depth) and is
 *  never culled for being behind the camera; it sorts as nearest, since a
 *  control is in front of the scene by definition.
 *
 *  ---- CARDS -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  A note may carry `card`: HTML for a short popover that opens when the
 *  student clicks the label (or its dot). The label says WHAT, the card
 *  says WHY, and the split is the point — a stage crowded with sentences
 *  is a stage nobody reads, and a stage of bare dots teaches nothing to
 *  the student who never clicks. Short label, always visible; one click
 *  for the reason.
 *
 *    notes.add({ text:'Na+ keeps its shell', card:'Two sentences. No more.',
 *                at:() => ..., offset:[30,-22] });
 *
 *  Keep a card to TWO SENTENCES. It is a margin note, not a paragraph, and
 *  the box is sized so a third one has to be scrolled to.
 *
 *  One card is open at a time, per layer. It closes on a second click, on
 *  Escape, on a click anywhere else, and on setMode/clear — because all of
 *  those mean the subject just changed.
 *
 *  How they LEAVE is show(false) or fade(x), and those are different
 *  things on purpose. show() is the switch a student flicks: these do not
 *  apply here. fade() is the dimmer a page drives: these are on their way
 *  out because the subject is changing. They multiply, and either reaching
 *  zero drops the layer out of the document — which is also what stops a
 *  faded-out callout catching clicks in 'click' mode. There is deliberately
 *  no staggered EXIT to match the wipe: arriving is an event worth making,
 *  leaving is the page moving on, and animating both makes the second one
 *  look like the first.
 *
 *  ---- USE -------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *    const notes = Annot.create(THREE, document.getElementById('stage'),
 *                               camera, { mode:'on' });
 *    notes.add({ text:'Iron (Fe)', at:() => hemeFe(), tone:'iron' });
 *    ...
 *    notes.step();                    // in the render loop, before render
 *
 *  Load after scene.js; no dependency on MolLib, and it never sees SCALE —
 *  it is given world points and asks nothing about what they mean.

       THE DOT IS THE TRUTH AND THE LABEL IS THE TYPESETTING. A dot sits
       exactly on its anchor and never moves; the label is pushed off by a
       fixed screen-space offset and joined back by a drawn leader. This is
       not decoration, it is the only way two callouts on one 10 A group
       are readable at all — anchored strictly, a label on the iron and one
       on the ring holding it land within forty pixels of each other and
       the top one hides the other.

       `offset` is [dx, dy] in CSS pixels from the dot. dx<0 puts the label
       on the left and flips the leader with it. The leader's length and
       angle are solved from the offset ONCE, here, because the offset is
       screen-space and constant — recomputing it per frame would burn a

       A stage is rarely all free: the lesson shell parks a panel down the

       from the stage element itself — kit/lesson-shell.js hangs `keepOut` on
       its stage the same way it hangs `viewOffset`, so a component gets this
       without being handed anything. A note whose LABEL would land over the
       region flips it to the free side; the DOT DOES NOT MOVE, because the
       dot is the anchor and only the typesetting changes.

       It is the label's box that has to clear, not the dot: a dot well right
       of the panel still hangs its label leftward across it, which is what
       shipped looking fixed. So the width is measured — cached per note, and

       callouts, or the student reads it as a different kind of object.

       Anchors are scene points, and this one is a DOM element, so the
       element's box is taken in CSS pixels and UNPROJECTED back through the
       camera. The world point that comes out projects to exactly that pixel
       whatever the camera is doing, so the dot rides the control through
       orbit, zoom and resize with nothing else in the module knowing that
       chrome is involved.

         at: notes.atElement(slider, { gap: 16, yFrom: sliderInput })

       `gap` is CSS pixels to the LEFT of the element's left edge, so the dot
       stands off a panel rather than sitting on its border. `yFrom` takes the
       vertical centre from a different element: a labelled row's own centre
       falls between its name and its control and reads as a miss.

/* =====================================================================
 *  Notebook — a component's named parts, and the notes it carries
 *  A student asks "what are the two pumps?" and the honest answer is two
 *  callouts on the two proteins, not a paragraph. For that a page needs
 *  NAMES for the parts ("channel.K", "pump", "outside") and something to
 *  say about each in the library's voice. Every component's mount makes
 *  one of these and exposes note / notes / clearNotes / anchors on its
 *  handle:
 *      c.note('pump');                          // the library's note, on the thing
 *      c.note('pump', { text:'…', card:'…' });  // the page's own words, same anchor
 *      c.notes(['channel.K', 'pump']);          // exactly these; false clears
 *      c.anchors();                             // names, with the library text
 *  `facings` is the optional twin of `anchors`: name → function returning the
 *  world direction that part faces, for the parts where being on the far side
 *  of the model should fade the callout out. Most parts have none.
 *  It lives in this file, not beside card-stage.js, so that loading
 *  annotate.js is all a page has to remember: a generated page that
 *  reached for callouts loaded this and forgot a second script, and every
 *  note silently no-oped.
 *  Anchors are FUNCTIONS by the rule above; one that answers null (no
 *  pump in this layout, no Na⁺ yet) parks the note off screen.
