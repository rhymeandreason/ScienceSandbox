       plasma membrane is the same organelle in both cells, and the animal
       cell paints it salmon. A plant cell is a green cell in a green wall,
       and a salmon band wrapped round the protoplast reads as a wound rather
       than as a boundary. So the plant keeps its own greens here, and the
       link back to the animal cell's membrane is carried by the plasmodesmata
       instead. Do not copy this exception to another organelle.

       `head` / `tail` PAINT THE CUT LIP AS A BILAYER, the same two bands the
       animal cell's lip carries and the same relationship — a saturated head
       over a paler, warmer tail — in this tissue's green. `head` is a shade
       under `membrane` so the leaflet reads as a line against the flank it
       is continuous with.

       Everything else in the cell takes the house colour from `organelles`. */

    /* ---- the respiratory machinery ----
       The complexes and the synthase are drawn twice: once in the inner
       membrane of cell/organelles.js's detailed mitochondrion, and once as
       a machine in membrane/membrane.js's bilayer. A student zooms from one
       to the other, so the gold thing making ATP has to be the same gold
       both times. membrane.js typed these inline first; they are here now
       and both read them.

       THE FOUR COMPLEXES ARE ONE FAMILY OF BLUES, because they are one
       chain and telling them apart is the label's job, not the colour's.
       Complex II is the paler one on purpose: it is the member that does
       NOT pump, and the eye should be able to find it. */
