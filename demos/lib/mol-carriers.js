/* =====================================================================
 *  mol-carriers.js — what every pathway spends and reduces
 * =====================================================================
 *  ATP, ADP's stand-in Pᵢ, AMP, NADH, FAD/FADH₂, and coenzyme A with the two
 *  thioesters the cycle makes of it. Plus `atpSkel` and `nadhSkel`, the same
 *  ATP and NADH built a second way — see THE PAIRS below.
 *
 *  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. No page draws a pathway without drawing its carriers,
 *  and before this file they were scattered across four:
 *
 *    mol-pathways.js   atp, nadh, pi     — so krebs-lab loaded glycolysis
 *    mol-krebs.js      FAD, CoA and the  — the two largest Skel builds in the
 *                      thioesters          repo, in a file glycolysis-lab does
 *                                          not load and cannot use
 *    mol-compare.js    atpSkel, nadhSkel — and THREE lesson pages drew their
 *                                          carriers from it
 *    mol-monomers.js   amp
 *
 *  The partition is by derivation and scale family, not by topic (molecules.js
 *  DOMAINS), and a carrier passes that test on its own: every spec here is
 *  all but AMP are Skel builds. What made the old arrangement
 *  wrong was not the taxonomy but the cost — a page paying for a pathway it
 *  never draws in order to reach the carrier it does.
 *
 *  mol-krebs.js is now the eight acids and nothing else. mol-compare.js and
 *  mol-monomers.js are gone.
 *
 *  ---- THE PAIRS: the same molecule, derived two ways --------------------
 *
 *  `atpSkel` and `nadhSkel` are ATP and NADH from ideal VSEPR angles and
 *  measured bond lengths; `atp` and `nadh` are real PubChem conformers. Same
 *  molecules, same scale family, two derivations each, and molecule-viewer.html
 *  switches between them under one camera.
 *
 *  THE SCHEMATICS ARE WHAT THE LESSONS DRAW, not the conformers —
 *  `ATP = M.atpSkel`, `NADH = M.nadhSkel` in glycolysis-lab, krebs-lab and
 *  fermentation-lab — because a real conformer folds its tail over the exact
 *  part each step is about: the γ phosphate at glycolysis steps 1/3/7/10, the
 *  nicotinamide C4 and its two hydrogens at step 6. The idealized build is
 *  extended, so those stay legible while the sugars beside them stay measured.
 *
 *  So a "control" here is load-bearing for three lesson pages. Changing one —
 *  its geometry, its `gly` block, its `view` — is a lesson change, and
 *  check-pages.js will not tell you: it checks that a page loads what it
 *  references, not that an edit was meant for both readers.
 *
 *  WHY BOTH ARE KEPT. MolecularGeometry.md §1.6 says derive when shape carries
 *  the lesson and schematize when topology does, and that the failure is doing
 *  one while claiming the other. The pairs make that trade something you can
 *  look at:
 *
 *    ATP    built 1.02 Å out of its own plane, 14.4 Å across
 *           conformer 1.33 Å, 9.6 Å
 *    NADH   built 1.01 Å, 21.4 Å  ·  conformer 1.91 Å, 12.0 Å
 *
 *  A schematic is flat and EXTENDED whatever you feed it, because every torsion
 *  opens outward; a real conformer folds back, and the bigger the molecule the
 *  further it folds. The cost of schematizing is not a constant — it grows, and
 *  NADH is on the shelf to show it growing.
 *
 *  WHAT MAKES THE COMPARISON HONEST. A hand-built ribose has four stereocentres
 *  and no internal check can catch a global mirror (MolecularGeometry.md §1.3);
 *  nadhSkel has TWO of them. Without an external reference, "the two look
 *  different" would confound "different method" with "I got the sugar wrong",
 *  which is the confusion the comparison exists to remove. Hence `smiles` and a
 *  tools/check-handedness.js REF entry pointing at the SAME PubChem record the
 *  conformer matches. NADH goes one better: its generated `smiles` is
 *  byte-identical to `nadh`'s.

    //   THE CLAIM THIS MOLECULE MAKES is the phosphate chain: three of them in
    //   a row, α through γ, with γ on the end. That is the whole reason ATP is
    //   the currency and the whole reason the page can take one off. `gamma`
    //   is the phosphoryl group that TRANSFERS — P plus its three terminal O.
    //   The bridging O between β and γ stays behind and becomes a terminal
    //   oxygen of ADP, which is what a kinase actually does: it moves PO₃⁻,

  /* =====================================================================
   *  COENZYME A, AND THE TWO THIOESTERS THE CYCLE MAKES OF IT
   * =====================================================================
   *  DRAWN IN FULL, all seventy-odd atoms, and that is a deliberate answer to
   *  a real question. Only the thiol end reacts: everything from the amide
   *  nitrogens back through the pantothenate arm to adenine and its three
   *  phosphates is a HANDLE, untouched by every step that uses it. Truncating
   *  to the business end would be defensible and this file does not do it, for
   *  two reasons the lesson depends on:
   *
   *    · THE SIZE IS THE POINT. Acetyl-CoA delivers TWO carbons to a
   *      four-carbon acceptor, and it is the biggest molecule on the stage by
   *      a wide margin. A student who sees the acetyl group next to the
   *      apparatus that carries it has the right picture of what a coenzyme
   *      IS: mostly recognition surface, with a tiny reactive tip. Drawn
   *      truncated, acetyl-CoA looks like a small molecule and "carrier"
   *      becomes a word rather than a shape.
   *    · IT IS HALF AN ADENINE NUCLEOTIDE, like ATP and NAD⁺ before it. Three
   *      carriers on three pages, all built on the same ADP core, is a fact
   *      worth being able to SEE — and it is the standard argument for the RNA
   *      world, which is a Bio 101 idea this repo can actually draw.
   *
   *  So the cost is paid here rather than in the drawing, which is exactly why
   *  this file is separate from mol-pathways.js (see the header).
   *
   *  ONE SKELETON, THREE SPECS. `buildCoA()` returns the whole thing plus the
   *  index of its sulfur; CoA-SH caps that with a hydrogen and the two
   *  thioesters put an acyl group there instead. Building them separately is
   *  how the acetyl and succinyl forms end up disagreeing about a molecule
   *  they share ninety percent of.
   */

  /* Remove one atom and close the gap, remapping every bond. Skel has no such
   * operation and should not grow one for this: `centroid()` reduces over the
   * whole array, so a hole left in place makes the very next `grow` throw, and
   * a builder that can leave holes is a builder every caller has to know about.
   * Doing it here, once, immediately, keeps that contained — the returned map
   * is applied to the handful of indices still live at the call site. */
  /* THE FORMULAS ARE THE LITERATURE'S, for the anion each spec declares —
   * hydrogen included, even though these builds draw almost none of it.
   * check-molecules.js excludes H from its comparison for exactly this reason
   * (a spec's H count is a drawing decision, a formula's is a chemical one)
   * and checks every heavy element against the atoms actually built, so these
   * strings are pinned to the skeleton on every count that can be. */

  /* AN EXTENDED CHAIN OF MIXED ELEMENTS, in the plane, at the real ~111°.
   *
   * `chainC` does this for carbon at one bond length; CoA's arm is twelve
   * atoms of C, N and S at five different lengths, and it has to come out
   * EXTENDED. Grown atom-by-atom with `grow` it does not: slot 0 is seeded
   * away from the centroid of everything placed so far (`outwardAt`), which is
   * exactly right for splaying a substituent into open space and wrong for a
   * long chain hanging off a heavy head — the centroid barely moves, every
   * step turns the same way, and the arm curls into an arc until its two
   * amides collide. check-molecules.js reported that as three overlapping
   * pairs, which is how it was found.
   *
   * So the backbone is LAID DOWN, not grown: alternating steps 34.5° either
   * side of −Y, which is the same construction `chainC` uses (90° − 111°/2)
   * and puts every bond angle at 111° by arithmetic rather than by hope.
   * Substituents are still grown afterwards — by then each backbone atom has
   * two neighbours, so `freeTet`/`freeSp2` return the out-of-plane pair and
   * the well-behaved case is the only one left.
   *
   * THE ARM'S CONFORMATION IS A DECLARED SCHEMATIC (MolecularGeometry.md
   * §1.6). A real pantetheine arm is a floppy rotor and adopts no particular
   * shape; fully extended is the legible one, it is what every textbook draws,
   * and nothing in the lesson rests on its torsions. What the lesson does rest
   * on — that the arm is LONG, and holds the reactive sulfur far from the
   * nucleotide — is exactly what extending it shows.

   *  Succinate → fumarate is the one oxidation in the cycle that does NOT
   *  reduce NAD⁺, and the reason is worth a molecule: taking two hydrogens off
   *  a plain C–C to make a C=C releases less energy than oxidising an alcohol
   *  to a ketone, not enough to reduce NAD⁺, and FAD's flavin sits at the
   *  lower potential that can take it. That is why the cycle's ledger reads
   *  3 NADH + 1 FADH₂ rather than 4 NADH, and why FADH₂ is worth fewer ATP
   *  downstream — it enters the chain at complex II, past the first pump.
   *
   *  THE SAME TWO-STATE SHAPE AS ATP/ADP AND NAD⁺/NADH — one molecule, two
   *  states, differing by the atoms a step moves (kit/carriers.js's contract).
   *  Here the difference is TWO HYDROGENS, on N1 and N5 of the flavin, and
   *  `redox` names them so a page can hide exactly those to show the oxidised
   *  form. FADH₂ is built as the full molecule and FAD is FADH₂ minus that
   *  pair, so the two cannot disagree about where the hydrogens go.
   *
   *  ISOALLOXAZINE, drawn flat and drawn in full. Three fused six-rings in a
   *  row — dimethylbenzene, then the pyrazine that carries N5 and N10, then
   *  the pyrimidinedione with its two carbonyls — and every one of them is
   *  aromatic or conjugated, so `flatRing`/`fuseRing` keep the whole system in
   *  one plane. A tetrahedral builder would pucker it, and a puckered flavin
   *  is not a flavin: the ring system is planar precisely so it can stack, and
   *  stacking is how it sits in its enzyme.
   *
   *  AND IT IS A NUCLEOTIDE TOO — flavin adenine DInucleotide. Ribitol (an
   *  open-chain sugar alcohol, NOT a ring — the "flavin mononucleotide" half
   *  is famously not a real nucleotide for exactly that reason), a

    /* — nadhSkel: NADH from ideal geometry.
     *
     *  The same exercise as atpSkel, one molecule further out: NADH is a
     *  DINUCLEOTIDE, so where ATP ends after one sugar this one runs
     *  adenine–ribose–P–O–P–ribose–nicotinamide, with a second furanose and its
     *  four stereocentres on the far end of the bridge. That is the point of
     *  building it — the schematic's cost is supposed to grow with the molecule,
     *  and a viewer that only ever showed the cheap case would not say so.
     *
     *  FIVE RINGS, THREE BUILDERS, and each is the one the ring's own physics
     *  asks for: adenine and the dihydronicotinamide are laid out flat
     *  (`flatRing`/`fuseRing`) because sp2 ring systems ARE flat and a
     *  tetrahedral builder would pucker them; both riboses come out of
     *  `ringFuranose` and take their identity from `face()`.
     *
     *  CHARGE STATE follows `nadh` in mol-pathways.js: the NEUTRAL molecule,
     *  so each phosphate carries its –OH rather than the bare O⁻ atpSkel shows.
     *  A derivation control that differed in protonation as well as in method
     *  would confound the two, which is the one thing it exists not to do.
     *
     *  WHAT IS SCHEMATIC HERE, declared per MolecularGeometry.md §1.6:
     *   · The dihydronicotinamide ring is drawn as a regular planar hexagon at
     *     the aromatic C–C length. The real 1,4-dihydropyridine is a shallow
     *     boat, and its two bonds INTO the sp3 C4 are ~1.50 Å, not 1.39. What
     *     the picture claims is the thing the lesson claims — C4 is sp3 and
     *     carries two hydrogens, one of them the hydride, so the ring is no
     *     longer aromatic — and that IS built: the two H's come from freeTet(),
     *     which straddles the ring plane at the tetrahedral angle. It is also
     *     the claim check-molecules.js's `gly.nic` block asserts.
     *   · Both glycosidic torsions and the two ester torsions along the
     *     pyrophosphate are set by a spin constant, the same standing the
     *     disaccharides' φ/ψ have: floppy in solution, declared, unchecked.
