 *  graphdata.js — the node graph's content, and nothing that draws it.
 *  Loaded before nodegraph.html's own script; exposes
 *  window.GraphData = { UNITS, LADDER, NODES, EDGES }.
 *
 *  Two units built end to end (water, proteins) plus the macromolecule
 *  bridges between them, per docs/Biology-Node-Graph.md. The schema is
 *  that doc's, cut to v1:
 *
 *  NODES — typed. `type` is one of:
 *      concept    a reusable idea (Polarity, Specificity)
 *      structure  a thing that physically exists (Water molecule, Tertiary)
 *      process    something that happens (Folding, Transpiration)
 *      question   an anchoring question; `text`, no claim
 *      theme      a deliberate high-degree hub (Structure–Function)
 *  Structure and process are split from concept on purpose: half of
 *  biology's difficulty is conflating an object with what it does.
 *
 *  `level` is the scale ladder integer (LADDER below), on the node as an
 *  ATTRIBUTE, not as edges — the ladder is the axis nodes sit on, not a
 *  parallel skeleton. A process carries `occursAt` instead (it has no
 *  size, it has a location), an emergent property `emergesAt`, and a
 *  concept carries nothing: null level is correct, not missing.
 *
 *  `unit` picks the tint (UNITS). `subject:'chemistry'` marks a
 *  cross-subject prerequisite — the edges students stall on, flagged so
 *  the map can offer a bridge instead of a dead end.
 *
 *  EDGES — [from, type, to, rank]. Directed; the type reads left to
 *  right ("polarity prerequisite-of hbond"). Rank is intrinsic strength:
 *      1  the spine; what expanding a card deals first
 *      2  enrichment, one step in
 *      3  true, surfaced on request
 *  Soft budget: about five rank-1 edges per node, enforced while
 *  authoring. The one deliberate exception is hbond, the water unit's
 *  mechanism hub — every property routes through it.
 *
 *  ROUTING RULE (the water lesson): a consequence attaches to the
 *  property that causes it, never to water-mol directly. Attach to the
 *  most specific node that fits.
