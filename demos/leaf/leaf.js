/* =============================================================================
 *  leaf/leaf.js — a leaf in cross-section, built from a seed
 * =============================================================================
 *  Five tissue layers on a block: lower epidermis with stomata, spongy
 *  mesophyll with a vascular bundle through it, palisade mesophyll, upper
 *  epidermis, cuticle. Every cell is placed by a seeded generator, so the
 *  same seed is the same leaf and "regenerate" is a new seed.
 *
 *  This is the cell-and-tissue scale of the component library, and the first
 *  that is not a molecule: nothing here is measured, the proportions are a
 *  textbook diagram's, and it says so. Prop tier.
 *
 *      Leaf.create(THREE, root, camera, opts)     the model: root is yours
 *      Leaf.mount(el, params)                     one box, one handle
 *
 *  Params, all live through set(next, {snap}). explode, aperture and the
 *  isolate fade GLIDE; a caller following a drag passes {snap:true} so the
 *  value tracks the thumb. Anything that rebuilds geometry snaps regardless.
 *
 *  Params:
 *      explode     0..1, the layers lifted apart
 *      seed        integer; changing it rebuilds
 *      isolate     a layer name to keep opaque while the rest fade, or null
 *      autoRotate  the block turns slowly
 *      aperture    0..1, the stomata shut to open. Turgid guard cells bow
 *                  apart; drained, they meet and the pore closes.
 *      flows       {co2, o2, vapour, sap} each 0..1, drawn as real molecules.
 *                  The three that pass a pore are MULTIPLIED BY `aperture`,
 *                  so shutting the stomata stops the gas exchange and leaves
 *                  the sap running. That trade is the lesson.
 *      layers      heights in scene units: {cuticle, upperEpi, palisade,
 *                  spongy, lowerEpi}; changing one rebuilds
 *      width, depth   the block, x and z
 *
 *  Layer names, bottom to top: lowerEpi · spongy · bundle · palisade ·
 *  upperEpi. The bundle explodes with the spongy layer it runs through.
 *
 *  state(): {explode, seed, isolate, aperture, flows, hovered, layers:[{name, y, height}]}
 *  Events: 'hover' (name | null) · 'select' (name | null) · 'frame' (state)
 *
 *  Three r128 has no CapsuleGeometry and no RoundedBoxGeometry in the global
 *  build; lib/geo.js carries both, so load it first.

  /* ---- the traffic ----
     A leaf's job is traffic, so the flows are the point of the model and the
     tissues are the setting. Four of them: CO2 in, O2 out, water vapour out
     (all three through the stomata), and sap along the vein.

     THEY ARE DRAWN AS MOLECULES, WITH THEIR ATOMS. A coloured dot needs a key;
     linear O=C=O and a bent water do not, and a student who has met them in a
     molecule lesson meets the same shapes here. It also makes the exchange
     legible as chemistry rather than as two colours of traffic.

     THE SIZE IS A LIE, AND A DECLARED ONE (docs/Scale.md). An epidermal cell
     is drawn 0.85 units and is really about 30 um, so a unit is roughly 35 um
     here; a CO2 molecule is about 0.33 nm across and is drawn 0.5 units, or
     about 18 um. That is some 53,000x, which is in SCALE.exag so a page reads
     it rather than guessing. The size was chosen by looking: below this a
     molecule is a speck at the default framing and the shape — the whole
     reason for drawing atoms at all — is lost. These are pictograms with the
     right shape, not molecules to scale, and `unit` stays null so nothing can
     print a size off any of it.

     Atom colours come from palette.js, never typed (CLAUDE.md), so a CO2 here
     and a CO2 in a molecule lesson are the same red and the same grey. */

    /* ---- lighting, the way water-lab does it ----
       NO SHADOW MAPS. water-lab casts none at all, and that is most of why it
       reads soft: a cast shadow between cells packed this tightly is a black
       wedge, and softening one costs a fill light that flattens everything
       else to pay for it. Form here comes from the normals and from the
       colours, which is enough for a diagram.

       LIGHTS RIDE THE CAMERA, which is Stage's own decision and the reason
       orbiting a water molecule reads as turning the model under a fixed
       studio lamp rather than sweeping a lamp across it. World-fixed lights
       put the leaf's underside in the dark exactly when the student turns it
       over to look at the stomata. So Stage's key and fill are kept, only
       warmed and rebalanced for a green subject, and the leaf adds its own
       key to the CAMERA rather than to the scene.

       Stage's ambient stays high. It is what keeps anything from going to
       black, and dimming it is what made the first pass of these colours look
