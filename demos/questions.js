/* =====================================================================
 *  questions.js — the question bank, and the topics they connect.
 *  Loaded as a classic script BEFORE a page's own script; exposes
 *  window.QuestionBank = { CONCEPTS, QUESTIONS }.
 *
 *  This is CONTENT, not a module: no behaviour, no DOM, nothing to call.
 *  It is split out because more than one page will read it —
 *  `concept-map.html` draws it as a graph today.
 *
 *  CONCEPTS — the topics a question can name. `id` is what a question
 *  refers to; `built` says whether an engine for it is on disk, which is
 *  the only thing that has to be kept true as lessons ship.
 *
 *  QUESTIONS — one row each:
 *
 *      ['Why are snowflakes six-sided?', ['crystal','water'], 1]
 *        the question                      the concepts        rank
 *
 *  The CONCEPTS a question names are the editorial claim: two ids means
 *  the question sits between those two lessons, three means no single
 *  lesson answers it. A question whose ids are all one lesson is a
 *  caption, not a connection.
 *
 *  RANK is how well the question opens a card — 1 introduces the idea
 *  from cold, 2 follows up, 3 is depth. It is written per question and
 *  read per card, so the test is: if a student landed on any card this
 *  question names, is this a good first thing to ask there?
 *
 *  Every row is a question, ending in a question mark. A statement is a
 *  caption and belongs in the lesson, not here.
 *
 *  An id no CONCEPT defines is dropped silently by the consumer rather
 *  than throwing, so a typo costs the question an edge and says nothing.

  /* Each row is [question, the concepts it needs, rank, per-lesson ranks?].
     Rank is how well the question opens a card: 1 introduces the idea from cold,
     2 follows up, 3 is depth. It orders a fan when a card is expanded — rank 1
     nearest the card, the rest reading outward — so the first thing a student
     sees off any card is its best way in, not row order.

     The same question rarely opens two cards equally well, so a row may carry
     a fourth element overriding the rank for named lessons:

       ['Why does the helix twist?', ['dna','water'], 3, { dna: 1 }]

     — depth from Water, the way in from DNA. Anything not named there falls
     back to the plain rank, which is why most rows have no fourth element. */
