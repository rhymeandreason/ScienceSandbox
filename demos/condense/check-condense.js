/* =============================================================================
 *  condense/check-condense.js
 * =============================================================================
 *  The component's one claim, asserted rather than grepped for: EVERY PAIR IT
 *  ACCEPTS LOSES EXACTLY ONE WATER, and which molecule gives up the oxygen is
 *  read from that molecule's own `condense` roles.
 *
 *  It RUNS the code. `condense.js` needs THREE only inside `create`, and
 *  `linkageOf`, `macromolecule/` and every `mol-*` file are Node-loadable, so
 *  this resolves real pairs against real specs instead of reading source the
 *  way reaction/check-reaction.js has to.
 *
 *  THE THREE THINGS THAT BREAK SILENTLY:
 *
 *   1. A PAIR THAT LOSES SOMETHING OTHER THAN WATER. The component draws a
 *      water unconditionally once the leaving atoms are off, so a pair whose
 *      roles shed an extra hydrogen renders a perfectly good water and a
 *      molecule quietly two atoms light.
 *   2. THE OXYGEN COMING FROM THE WRONG SIDE. A sugar takes it from the
 *      ACCEPTOR and an ester and a peptide from the DONOR — the mirror, and a
 *      branch on the linkage name is right for two classes and backwards for
 *      the third with everything still rendering. This asserts the direction
 *      per class, so a `condense` block edited in the library fails here.
 *   3. A PAIR THE REFERENCE PROMISES AND THE CODE REFUSES. Every pair named in
 *      docs/Components.md's section has to resolve, or a generated page mounts
 *      the component and gets an exception.
 *
 *  `node condense/check-condense.js`, offline, no dependencies.
 * ========================================================================== */
