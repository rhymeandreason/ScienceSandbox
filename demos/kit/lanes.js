/* =============================================================================
 *  kit/lanes.js — molecules side by side, named, that split and swap
 * =============================================================================
 *  The shape every pathway lesson has: one molecule on stage becomes two, each
 *  keeps running, each carries its name, and a step replaces one lane's
 *  molecule without disturbing the other. Glycolysis is the first, not the
 *  last — respiration, photosynthesis, fermentation and the pentose phosphate
 *  pathway are all "n lanes, swap one, sometimes split".
 *
 *  Everything here was got right once in glycolysis-lab.html and is worth more
 *  than the code it takes, because each of these is invisible until it is wrong:
 *
 *   · A LANE IS CENTRED ON THE MOLECULE, not on its origin. A spec keeps
 *     whatever origin its source used, so a lopsided one sits off the lane axis
 *     and reads as the whole stage being off-centre.
 *   · THE VERTICAL TWIN. A spec is centred on its centroid, not the middle of
 *     what you SEE — a phosphate tail hanging down with nothing above to
 *     balance leaves the molecule loitering under its own name. Move the
 *     MOLECULE, never the camera: re-centring the camera per state slides the
 *     scene between steps and turns a split into a camera move.
 *   · ONE SHARED LABEL BASELINE, passed in, not derived per molecule. Two names
 *     at different heights read as two different SIZES of thing.
 *   · A LABEL'S WIDTH IS IN PIXELS AND THE LANES' SEPARATION IS NOT. A DOM
 *     label keeps its width as the camera pulls back, so two names run through
 *     each other on a narrow stage. Each gets the space between the lanes.
 *   · ABBREVIATE FIRST, THEN SHRINK, and decide it for ALL lanes at once. Per
 *     lane, the narrow name abbreviates while the wide one stays systematic and
 *     the pair reads as two kinds of thing.
 *   · POSITIONS ARE TARGETS. A product placed straight onto its own centring
 *     JUMPS on the swap frame — the frame the name returns — so it reads as the
 *     label shoving the molecule down. It starts where the outgoing molecule
 *     stood and eases.
 *
 *  Names are DOM, not sprites: sharp at any zoom, selectable, sized by the
 *  page's type scale rather than the camera. The tracking a sprite gives free is
 *  paid explicitly — every frame each anchor is projected and the label parked
 *  over it. That is `drawPlates`, and it must run AFTER the render (kit's
 *  `afterFrame`) or the label is pinned to the previous frame's camera.
 *
 *  WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT OWN: which molecule a step produces, when a step
 *  runs, what a name says. The page passes `specOf`, `label` and `plateHTML`.
 *
 *  Loaded after scene.js. Exposes window.Lanes.
