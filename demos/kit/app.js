/* =============================================================================
 *  kit/app.js — one tag loads a generated app's library
 * =============================================================================
 *  A generated page used to name every file it needed, in order, and get it
 *  wrong: both molecule families at once (molecules.js throws on the second),
 *  a component without the module its scene is built from (throws at mount, on
 *  a line the author never sees), geo.js after card-stage.js, lesson-shell.js
 *  anywhere. Four rules stated in prose and enforced by nothing. Here they are
 *  a table, and a page that says WHAT IT MOUNTS cannot express any of them:
 *
 *      <script src="../kit/app.js" data-shell="steps" data-use="Membrane,Graph"></script>
 *
 *  `data-shell` picks the template the same way: the step-through is the base
 *  every other one is built on, so it is in CORE and a template adds only its
 *  own file, after it.
 *
 *  THIS TABLE IS THE ONE COPY. api/_builder.js reads this file for what each
 *  component needs, so the reference handed to the model no longer carries a
 *  script list per section and cannot drift from what actually loads. Adding a
 *  component means adding a line to USES, and nothing else.
 *
 *  document.write, deliberately. The library is globals with a load order and
 *  no build; a tag written during parse runs in the order it was written and
 *  before the page's own inline script, which is the property every generated
 *  page depends on. Injecting the tags instead would make every one of those
 *  scripts async and every page a callback. The cost is that this file must be
 *  a plain synchronous script in the body, which is where the reference puts
 *  it. Hand-built lessons do not use this: they name their files, and someone
 *  reads them.
 * ========================================================================== */
