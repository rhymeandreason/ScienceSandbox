/* =============================================================================
 *  kit/lesson-shell.js — the step-through shell a generated app runs in
 * =============================================================================
 *  A full-window scene with a glass panel over it: eyebrow, title, body,
 *  a controls slot the step fills, Back and Next, progress dots in the top
 *  bar, arrow keys. The tree prototype's UI, made the one shell every
 *  user-generated app takes so they all read as one product.
 *
 *      const shell = LessonShell.create({
 *        brand: 'The Mass of a Tree',
 *        hint:  'Drag to orbit · Scroll to zoom',
 *        steps: [{ eyebrow, title, body, nextLabel, camera,
 *                  onEnter(ctx), onExit(ctx),
 *                  onLeave(ctx, to) -> seconds to hold before the swap }, ...],
 *        ctx:   {},                       // handed to every step; the shell adds `ui` and `goTo`
 *        onStep: (step, i) => {},         // after the panel is filled, before onEnter
 *      });
 *      Component.mount(shell.stage, ...)  // one component: it goes in shell.stage
 *      shell.goTo(0);
 *
 *  MORE THAN ONE COMPONENT IS MORE THAN ONE BOX, and the shell hands them out:
 *
 *      const cell = shell.scene('cell', el => PlantCell.mount(el, { viewOffset: shell.viewOffset }));
 *      const m    = shell.scene('membrane', el => Membrane.mount(el, { viewOffset: shell.viewOffset }));
 *      steps: [{ ..., scene: 'cell' }, { ..., scene: 'membrane' }]
 *
 *  Each `scene()` makes its own full-bleed layer inside the stage, mounts into
 *  it, and returns a handle that behaves as the component does — `set`,
 *  `state`, `on`, `note` and the rest — for as long as the page holds it. Only
 *  a few scenes stay live (`sceneLimit`, 4): a WebGL context is rationed and
 *  the pool destroys the least recently shown, so the handle is what the page
 *  keeps and the instance under it is the shell's to rebuild. The stage is ONE element, so two mounts on
 *  `shell.stage` put two canvases in one block flow: the first fills the
 *  window, the second sits below it off screen still rendering, and the first
 *  one's overlays (side labels, the annotation layer) draw over whichever
 *  canvas is on top. It renders, so nobody sees it as a fault. A second canvas
 *  landing directly in the stage therefore throws, naming this call.
 *
 *  A step names the scene it shows in `scene`; the shell shows it, hides the
 *  rest and stops them, before onStep and onEnter run. A step that names none
 *  keeps whatever the last one resolved, and the first swap falls back to the
 *  first scene registered, so a page can name the scene only on the steps that
 *  change it. `scene` may be an array: several visible at once split the stage
 *  into equal columns, which is there for a template with a layout, not for
 *  the step-through, whose panel covers a column's worth of the window.
 *
 *  It owns the DOM and the step index and nothing about the scene: the
 *  camera flight a step names in `camera` is the page's to fly, in onStep,
 *  because the shell does not know which component is behind the glass.
 *  `shell.viewOffset` is the function every component's mount takes to
 *  centre its scene in the room the panel leaves. The stage also carries
 *  `keepOut`, the panel's rect, which lib/annotate.js reads on its own so a
 *  callout behind the glass typesets to the free side.
 *
 *  ctx.ui, for steps — each is on ctx directly as well, so ctx.q === ctx.ui.q:
 *      controls(html)  fill the slot · q(sel) / qa(sel) inside it · show(el) /
 *      hide(el) · setNext(label, visible) · range(input, onChange) paints the
 *      track, fires once with the current value, and RETURNS sync(v) for
 *      writing that slider from code · showPanel(component,
 *      {only:['notes','layers','legend']}) appends the component's own chips
 *
 *  Controls a step's `controls(html)` can use, all styled by the sheet:
 *  `.btn` (.primary / .secondary / .ghost) · `.switch` · `.slider` · `.chips`
 *  with `.chip.is-on` for independent toggles · `.segmented` with `.is-on` for
 *  ONE choice among several · `.choices` · `.stats`.
 *
 *  Chrome is css/lesson-shell.css; `body.lshell-page` is set here. A step's
 *  `body` may be a function of ctx, for copy that depends on what the
 *  student did earlier.
 *
 *  THE PAGE IS ASKABLE FROM OUTSIDE, which the builder's outline needs and no
 *  lesson does: `LessonShell.current` is the live shell, and every swap fires
 *  `lessonshell:step` on the document with `{ i, n }`. A generated app is read
 *  through a sandboxed frame whose only handle on it is postMessage, so the
 *  alternative to a registration here is the builder parsing the `steps: [...]`
 *  array literal out of the source and being wrong about it. A page must not
 *  read `current` to find itself: `ctx` and the shell it holds are what a step
 *  is handed, and two shells on one document leave only the second registered.

       16 and silently drops the oldest past that: the symptom is a canvas
       going blank with no error, on the scene the student saw first. A page
       asking for six scenes is not obviously past a cap nobody states, so the
       shell holds a few live and destroys the rest — kit/card-stage.js's pool,
       keyed by scene name, least recently SHOWN evicted.

       Which is why `scene()` returns a handle and not the component. A pooled
       component is destroyed and rebuilt under the page, and a page holding
       the instance would be calling set() on a corpse — card-stage.js's header
       says it found exactly that. The handle forwards to whatever instance is
       live, mounts one if there is none, and carries across the two things a
       rebuild would otherwise lose: every `on()` the page subscribed, and the
       params it had `set()`. Nothing is built until something asks for it, so
       registering ten scenes costs nothing until the steps that show them.
