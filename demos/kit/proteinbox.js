/* =============================================================================
 *  kit/proteinbox.js — Proteinbox: a card that shows a deposited protein
 * =============================================================================
 *  kit/molbox.js draws a molecule built from a spec. This draws one measured in
 *  a lab: real angstroms, from files a baker wrote, in a scene of its own —
 *  which is what lets it BE angstroms, since one scale family per SCENE
 *  (MolecularGeometry.md 1.5) and the cards beside it are the small-molecule
 *  family.
 *
 *  IT DRAWS DNA AND RNA TOO, through kit/nucleic.js, on any chain the bake
 *  marks `kind:'na'` — a backbone ribbon per strand and one rung per base
 *  pair. A protein and a duplex in one bake share one box, one scale and one
 *  centre; `proteins/zif268/` is the worked example. Load kit/nucleic.js
 *  alongside kit/ribbon.js when a page has any, and the box says so if it is
 *  missing rather than drawing half a structure.
 *
 *  Four things it can show, and only the first is free:
 *
 *    ribbon   12 KB trace, tools/bake-trace.js       drawn on create
 *    surface  ~360 KB SES, tools/bake-card-surface.js  fetched on the click
 *    skin     the SAME surface, translucent, OVER the ribbon    `skin:true`
 *    fold     ~830 KB trajectory, HbFold + FoldPlay    fetched on the click
 *
 *  SKIN IS NOT A FOURTH FILE, it is the surface drawn the other way, and the
 *  difference between the two is a claim rather than a look. `surface` REPLACES
 *  the ribbon: the molecule is its outside, and what is under the skin is not
 *  the question. `skin` covers a ribbon that is still there, which is what a
 *  page asks for when the question is WHERE ON the fold something is — a
 *  binding site, a mutated residue, a patch of exposed grease. Opt in with
 *  `skin:true`; a gallery card asking for `surface` still means what it always
 *  did, and does not grow a third button.
 *
 *  ON THE SKIN, two ways to say something, and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 *    box.paintSkin((chain, num, name) => colour)   per-residue, one array
 *    box.patch('b6', {chains:'B,D', num:6}, {colour, opacity})
 *
 *  A paint recolours the skin in place — no rebuild, no refetch, and NOTHING
 *  MOVES, which is the point: a lesson claiming a substitution leaves the fold
 *  alone should be unable to move it while saying so. A patch is its own mesh
 *  over the same buffers, and it exists because one mesh has one opacity: a
 *  skin wants to be faint enough to see the ribbon through and a residue-sized
 *  marker wants to be solid, and per-vertex alpha only ever multiplies the
 *  material's. kit/surface.js carries the rest of that argument, and the rule
 *  that a triangle needs all three vertices on a residue to belong to it.
 *  Both may be called before the surface has loaded; they are remembered and
 *  applied when it lands.
 *
 *  SWITCHING STRUCTURES IS A SWAP, NOT A REBUILD. `setData(t, {keep:true})`
 *  and `setSurface(url)` replace the ribbon and the skin in place, each
 *  holding the old one up until the new one is ready — one WebGL context, one
 *  camera, the reader's turn kept. Destroying and re-creating a box to change
 *  molecule is what a flicker is, and on an A/B whose claim is that NOTHING
 *  MOVED, a flicker is the page contradicting itself.
 *
 *  THE GATES ARE THE DESIGN. A card is a thumbnail until a reader decides
 *  otherwise, and neither of the big two is ever something the box DOES to
 *  someone who scrolled past it: the bytes are asked for on the click, the
 *  ribbon stays up until they land, and the loop runs only while the fold is
 *  showing. The page adds the third gate — whether the controls are reachable
 *  at this zoom at all — because only the page knows how big its card is on
 *  screen. The door map does that with `.near`.
 *
 *  ONE DECODED SURFACE ACROSS EVERY BOX, for the same reason kit/card-stage.js
 *  rations contexts: 360 KB of quantised mesh becomes several MB of GPU
 *  buffers, and the LRU rations contexts, not what a page hangs off one. A box
 *  that loses its surface falls back to the ribbon it never removed.
 *
 *  WHAT IT DOES NOT OWN. Anything about the page around it: no lesson button,
 *  no modal, no `.near`. It owns the molecule and the two questions a reader
 *  can ask of it.
 *
 *  NO `cache:'force-cache'` ON ANY OF THESE FETCHES. It reads as the right
 *  thing to ask for — the files never change — but the dev server sends
 *  `no-store` so a reload never serves a stale page, and WebKit fails a
 *  force-cache request for a no-store resource outright rather than falling
 *  back to the network. Safari-only, and it presents as a box that never draws.
 *  Ordinary caching already does the job: these are static files with real
 *  cache headers in production, and the second box asking for one gets it from
 *  the memory cache anyway.
 *
 *  Every library is read by its BARE name, not off `global`: kit/ribbon.js
 *  publishes `const RibbonLib` at script top level, which is script scope and
 *  never a property of window — `global.RibbonLib` is undefined, and only at
 *  the moment a card tries to draw.
 *
 *  Needs, in load order: THREE, lib/scene.js, kit/ribbon.js,
 *  kit/card-stage.js. And only for the option that uses it —
 *  kit/surface.js for `surface`, hemoglobin/hbfold.js +
 *  hemoglobin/foldplay.js for `fold`.
 *
 *    const box = Proteinbox.create({
 *      mount, trace:'…/2HHB.trace.json',       // or data: a parsed one
 *      chains:'B',                             // default: every chain in the file
 *      surface:'…/2HHB.card.surf.bin',         // omit and there is no toggle
 *      fold:'…/2HHB-B.fold.bin',               // omit and there is no play button
 *    });
 *
 *  OR, by name, and then the registry answers all four:
 *
 *      Proteinbox.create({ mount, protein:'hemoglobin', base:'../' });
 *      Proteinbox.create({ mount, protein:'hemoglobin', variant:'2HBS' });
 *
 *  proteins/proteins.js names every artefact by ROLE — trace, card, fold —
 *  and check-proteins.js fails a role that is not on disk, so a caller
 *  rebuilding those names from a stem is standing a convention where a fact
 *  already is. An explicit path still wins, because hemoglobin-lab and the door
 *  map's VIEWS name files the registry has no role for.
 *
 *  `data:` is `trace:` already parsed — same object, no fetch — for a page
 *  whose coordinates arrive as something the box does not read. It does not
 *  read PDB and should not learn to: parsing decides which altloc, which
 *  chain, and whether secondary structure is read or detected, and a page
 *  that owns a protein already owns those. What is shared is the box.
 *
 *  `view:` is a 3x3 basis saying which way the structure should face, applied
 *  to the chain group so the camera stays the reader's.
 *
 *  TWO KINDS OF BASIS AND THEY LIVE IN DIFFERENT PLACES, which is the whole of
 *  the precedence `setData` applies — this option, then create's, then the
 *  bake's:
 *
 *    CHOSEN   a human turned the molecule and picked. Taste, not measurement,
 *             so it lives in proteins/proteins.js as `view:{by:'human',basis}`
 *             and is read at draw time. `protein:` picks it up here; a caller
 *             passing `data:` asks `ProteinLib.viewOf(p)` for it. Re-aiming a
 *             protein is then an edit and a reload, not a re-bake.
 *
 *    SOLVED   FoldLib.viewBasis worked it out from the shape. That IS a
 *             measurement, so it is baked beside the extents it came with, and
 *             it is the fallback whenever nobody has chosen. See viewBasis for
 *             why a globular domain gets none.
 *
 *  A protein whose registry entry holds a chosen basis bakes NO view at all,
 *  so a page that forgets to pass one opens in the deposited frame — visibly
 *  wrong rather than subtly, and the panel's `frame` row says why.
 *
 *  `afterFrame:` runs after every render, for a page drawing over the scene —
 *  an annotate.js layer's `step()`. Orbit moves the camera without advancing
 *  anything, so a label reprojected anywhere else shears off its atom on a
 *  drag.
 *
 *  `colors:` overrides the ss palette — one number for a flat colour, or
 *  {C,H,E} for some of it, or `{byChain:{A:…,B:…}}` where what has to be told
 *  apart is which strand rather than what it is folded into. Omit it and every
 *  protein in the repo is drawn the same way, which is the default for a
 *  reason.
 *
 *  Returns kit/card-stage.js's box, so a pool's acquire / snapshot / destroy
 *  work on it unchanged, plus `drop()` (back to ribbon, release the surface),
 *  `setData(t)` (draw a different structure in the same box, keeping the
 *  camera; `setData(t, {sub})` also moves the mesh density, for a bench with
 *  a samples-per-residue slider — recreating the box to change it costs a
 *  WebGL context per drag and throws away the reader's camera), `setPocket(p)`, `focus(f)`, `setGhost(o)` and `rep` for a caller that wants to know what is
 *  showing.
 *
 *  `focus({at:[x,y,z], radius, view, ghost}, ms)` leans the camera in on a few
 *  angstroms of the structure — a binding site — keeping the angle the reader
 *  turned to, and `focus(null, ms)` gives the whole protein back. A pocket is
 *  10 A across inside a 40 A protein, so a lesson about binding that never
 *  leans in is asking a reader to see a 0.3 A move from across the room.
 *  `view` is a basis for the close-up alone, since the angle that shows a
 *  protein is rarely the angle that shows one site in it; `ghost` fades the
 *  ribbon with the move; `ms` tweens all four together, which is what says
 *  the close-up is the same molecule.
 *
 *  `setGhost(opacity)` does the fade on its own, for a page that wants it
 *  without a move. It fades the ribbon and leaves setPocket's atoms solid,
 *  which is what makes a focused view readable: the container stays visible
 *  as a container. It survives setData, because a page that walked the meshes
 *  itself would lose the fade on the next switch and not be able to tell.
 *
 *  `setPocket({atoms, bonds}, {ball})` draws the few atoms that belong INSIDE
 *  the ribbon — a heme, what is bound to its iron, the side chain a bench is about
 *  — ball-and-stick, in the structure's frame, at the proportions BALL /
 *  FE_BALL / STICK below. It returns `{group, materials}` so a lesson can fade
 *  or tint them, and it clears with the ribbon on every setData. What is IN
 *  the pocket is the baker's decision, never the box's, for the same reason
 *  the box does not parse PDB. `ball` scales the whole group, for the one case
 *  the proportions below cannot cover on their own: a metal with nothing drawn
 *  around it to be sized against.

     A ribbon is what a protein is drawn as; these are the proportions for the

     one or two side chains a bench is about. 43 atoms is a shape you can read
     at 10 A across, which is exactly what 150 residues of the same treatment
     is not, and it is how every published figure draws a porphyrin.

     SMALLER BALLS AND FATTER STICKS THAN A CLOSE-UP, deliberately, and this is
     the part that is easy to get wrong from the outside. The subject is the
     group's SHAPE seen from across a 40 A protein, not its volume: BALL shrinks
     the house radii so a porphyrin reads as a ring rather than a clump of
     touching spheres, and STICK is more than twice the house ratio because at
     that distance the house width comes out about a pixel — a cobweb, not a
     bond. They are set independently, since one is set by how far away the bond
     is seen from and the other by how much volume the ring should have.

     FE_BALL is a MULTIPLE of the shrunk carbon, never an absolute, so the iron
     stays the biggest atom in the group at any size the rest is drawn at.

         box.setPocket({ atoms:[{el, p:[x,y,z]}], bonds:[[i,j]] })

       exactly the shape a baker writes beside the trace. Coordinates go in as
       baked — centred with the trace by the same vector — because the box owns
       the centring and a group centred on itself lands at the origin with the
       protein somewhere else.

       WHAT IS IN THE POCKET IS NOT THE BOX'S BUSINESS, the same refusal it
       makes about parsing: which residues, which ligand names count, whether a
       cross-residue bond is kept. Those decide what the picture CLAIMS, and a
       page that owns a protein owns them. What is shared is how they are drawn.

       SPLIT STICKS, each half in its own atom's colour — the structure style
       every published figure uses, and the right one here for the reason
       Modules.md gives: these are deposited coordinates with no spec and often
       no hydrogens, so the bond does more of the work of saying what the atoms
       are.

       IT DOES NOT WIDEN THE FRAME. A pocket is inside the protein by
       definition, so the framing radius stays the ribbon's; letting 43 atoms
       vote on it would be a bug nobody could see.

       Returns `{group, materials}` — one material per element plus one per
       bond colour — so a LESSON can fade the group in, tint it, or hide it
       without the box growing an opinion about timing. Call with no argument

     *  a view, and then never again. A structure already wearing V and looked
     *  at from camera C SHOWS C⁻¹·V, so copying C⁻¹ back drops the V that was
     *  on screen at the time, and the paste opens somewhere nobody chose. The
     *  failure is silent: a rotation is still a rotation, the protein still
     *  looks like a protein, and only the person who picked the view can tell.
     *
     *  So: read the group's rotation as well as the camera's, and return the
     *  product. `setData` seeds the canonical camera (theta 0, phi pi/2, which
     *  is the identity orientation) on the first structure with a view, which
     *  is what makes the returned basis mean the same thing when it is read
