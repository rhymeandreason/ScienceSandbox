/* =============================================================================
 *  macromolecule/peptide.js — where the next residue has to sit
 * =============================================================================
 *  A peptide bond is a condensation: the carboxyl keeps its C and loses –OH,
 *  the amino keeps its N and loses one H, and the two halves leave as one
 *  water. This file answers the only question a page cannot answer for itself
 *  — given a residue on stage, WHERE does the next one go — and it answers in
 *  a rigid transform, placing nothing.
 *
 *  SIX NUMBERS, AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS SET. The backbone is built from
 *  internal coordinates (`nerf` below), not by aiming one group at another:
 *
 *    · bond, angle, ψ — the amide N, placed off the host's own N, Cα and C.
 *    · angle, ω — where the guest's Cα has to point from there.
 *    · φ — the spin about N–Cα, measured off where the guest landed and
 *      corrected, since nothing above constrains it.
 *
 *  THE THREE TORSIONS ARE ASSERTED, and this is the correction the file exists
 *  in its current form because of. An earlier version placed the N where the
 *  departing hydroxyl O had been and then turned the guest until its leaving
 *  N–H pointed back down the bond. That looks like it derives everything from
 *  the molecules' own atoms, and it does — but the atoms it derives from are a
 *  free amino acid's CONFORMER, so φ and ψ came out at whatever PubChem had
 *  fetched. In a four-residue chain that gave φ of −179°, +60° and −64°: the
 *  left-handed region and the α-helical one, chosen by nobody. The chain bent,
 *  and two atoms landed 1.88 Å apart.
 *
 *  A torsion nobody sets is a torsion the record chose. So ω is trans, and φ/ψ
 *  are an extended β-strand — a real secondary structure rather than an
 *  invented straightening, and what a chain does when nothing folds it.
 *
 *  WHAT IS STILL THE CONFORMER'S: the side chain, and everything internal to a
 *  rigid residue. That is the right answer for a side chain and the wrong one
 *  for the surviving amide N–H, which is why `pose` also returns `amideH` —
 *  see the note at the end of it.
 *
 *  WHICH ATOMS ARE INVOLVED IS READ FROM `condense:`, never counted off the
 *  formula. A spec that renumbers cannot quietly start bonding the wrong atoms:
 *  check-molecules.js already asserts that each role names a real group and
 *  that the two roles together shed exactly one water.
 *
 *  THE α-CARBON IS FOUND, NOT INDEXED. It is the one heavy atom bonded to both
 *  the amino N and the carboxyl C. The library's fixed backbone order does put
 *  it at 3, but all three torsions are measured against it and a spec built
 *  some other way would read three silently wrong angles.
 *
 *  ÅNGSTRÖMS IN, ÅNGSTRÖMS OUT. No THREE, no scene, no page state, so
 *  check-macromolecule.js runs the whole file in Node.
