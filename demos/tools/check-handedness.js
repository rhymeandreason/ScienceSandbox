 *  check-handedness.js — an AUDIT, not a guard.
 *
 *  Compares each spec's committed `smiles` against a named reference record
 *  from PubChem. This is the only check here that can catch a GLOBAL MIRROR,
 *  and it is the only one that reaches outside for an absolute answer.
 *
 *    npm i && node tools/check-handedness.js
 *
 *  Why nothing else can do it. `stereo:{axial}` and `stereo:{faces}` assert
 *  RELATIVE patterns — the ring normal's sign falls out of traversal order, so
 *  flipping every substituent at once leaves the pattern unchanged. cod-check.js
 *  compares ring-plane tilt and torsions, also relative. haworth.js re-anchors
 *  the normal to the D convention, so it draws a correct D-sugar even from
 *  mirrored coordinates. Bond lengths, angles and the render are all identical
 *  between enantiomers. A mirror is invisible from the inside, by construction.
 *
 *  It found one: every Skel-built sugar in this library was the L-enantiomer.
 *  L-glucose, L-galactose, L-ribose, L-deoxyribose and both disaccharides,
 *  shipped and rendering beautifully. See molecule-pipeline.md item 5.
 *
 *  DELIBERATELY NOT WIRED INTO check-molecules.js. It needs the network and a
 *  dev-only dependency, and a network call inside a guard is a liability — the
 *  same reasoning as cod-check.js. Run it when you touch a builder, add a
 *  stereocentre, or doubt a spec. The answer cannot go stale on its own.
 *
 *  THE CONTROL MATTERS. The specs that came from PubChem must match, or the
 *  spec -> molblock -> RDKit path is what is broken, not the geometry. That is
 *  what separates "our sugar is mirrored" from "our exporter is mirrored", and
 *  it is why dAlanine is in the list: it must come back D.
 *
 *  Reference names are anomer- and stereo-specific ON PURPOSE. A bare "glucose"
 *  is CID 5793, which leaves the anomeric centre undefined and would prove
 *  nothing.

  /* THE REDUCED FORM IS THE ONE ANCHORED, and `fad` is deliberately absent.

   * simplification in that file, since both forms render as the same flat
   * tricycle and what the lesson needs is that two hydrogens moved. So this
   * spec's `fad` genuinely is not PubChem's FAD (theirs is the oxidised,
   * aromatic isoalloxazine) and pointing a row at it would report a mismatch
   * for something already decided and written down.
   *
   * Anchoring `fadh2` loses nothing that matters here. Every stereocentre in
   * the molecule — ribitol's three, the ribose's four — is in the shared
   * skeleton, so checking either form checks both, and the drop that makes FAD
   * touches two hydrogens and no configuration.
   *
   * THIS ROW EARNED ITS PLACE: the first build of the ribitol was the
   * L-enantiomer. `hydroxyl(c, 0)` took whichever tetrahedral slot came first,
   * check-molecules.js passed it, and nothing inside the repo could see it —
   * exactly the sugars' failure of molecule-pipeline.md item 5, repeated. */

/* THE HAND-BUILT CONTROLS REFERENCE THEMSELVES.
 *
 * A spec in mol-compare.js is one molecule derived twice: `atpSkel` is `atp`
 * built from ideal geometry, and it says so — `compare:{against:'atp'}`. What
 * makes that comparison mean anything is that BOTH canonicalise to the same
 * external record, because a hand-built ribose has four stereocentres and no
 * internal check can catch a global mirror (MolecularGeometry.md §1.3). Without
 * it, "the two look different" confounds "different method" with "I got the
 * sugar wrong", which is the one confusion the comparison exists to remove.
 *
 * So the entry is DERIVED from `compare.against` rather than typed. Typed, it
 * was two lines saying what the spec already said, and the failure mode was
 * silent in the worst way: add a skel twin, forget the line, and the tool
 * reports every spec passing while never having looked at the new one. Nothing
 * about a molecule that is quietly unchecked is visible from its render.
 *
 * A control whose partner has no reference is an ERROR, not a skip: it means
 * the comparison has no anchor at either end.

// TWO DIFFERENCES THAT ARE NOT STEREOCHEMISTRY, normalised on both sides so a

//  · the house phosphate is four SINGLE P–O bonds (mol-pathways.js

//    lie), so RDKit completes P's valence with a hydride. Write it back as the
//    ordinary acid.
//  · PubChem answers some of these as the anion and some as the free acid.
//    Charge is not handedness.
//  · and the phosphorus STEREOCENTRES that normalisation then invents. A
//    bridging phosphate in the house style has four single P–O bonds and two
//    equivalent non-bridging oxygens; rewriting one of them as `=O` above makes
//    the four substituents formally distinct, so RDKit reads a configuration
//    off the 3D coordinates and tags `[P@@]`. PubChem's records carry no such
//    tag, and neither does the chemistry: the two oxygens are equivalent by
//    delocalisation (and both are O⁻ in the anion these specs actually draw).
//    Left in, it reports every geometry-derived diphosphate as a mismatch —

//    three fake ones. Phosphate stereochemistry is not a claim this library
