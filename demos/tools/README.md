# tools/sdf2spec.js

Converts a PubChem 3D record into a `MolLib` amino-acid spec, so the geometry in
`molecules.js` is derived rather than hand-guessed.

**The inputs are committed** — see `sdf/README.md`. You do not need to fetch
anything to re-run a conversion, and for `glutamine`/`glutamate` you must not:
their source conformers are no longer published, so a fresh fetch silently swaps
the geometry.

```bash
cd tools/sdf
node ../sdf2spec.js glycine alanine serine cysteine   # -> generated-specs.json
```

Fetching a NEW molecule, for reference — note the CID form, not the name form:
a bare name pins neither a stereocentre nor a charge state (`sdf/README.md` has
the case where that went wrong):

```bash
curl -o lysine.sdf "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/cid/5962/SDF?record_type=3d"
```

What it does, and why each step exists:

- **parse** — atoms, bonds, and BOND ORDERS from the SDF. The order column is
  what tags the carboxyl `C=O` as `[i,j,2]`; nobody has to spot it by hand.
- **reindex** — forces the library's fixed backbone order
  (`0 N · 1 H · 2 H · 3 Ca · 4 H · 5 C · 6 O(=O) · 7 O(–OH) · 8 H · 9.. R`),
  because `pep:{cC,oOH,hOH,nN,hN}` and `aminoacid-lab.html` index into it.
  A converter that reshuffled indices would silently break the peptide reaction.
- **reframe** — recentre on Ca, backbone N→C to +X, side chain to −Y, then apply
  ONE global `SCALE` (1.9). Display radii in this project are enlarged for
  legibility, so true Ångström coordinates bury every stick inside its spheres —
  a uniform scale clears them while keeping relative bond lengths truthful.
- **optH** — flags nonpolar C–H for the lab's "show C–H hydrogens" toggle.
  H on N/O/S is never flagged: those are the H-bond donors.

`check-molecules.js` (one directory up) validates the result — it reports every
bond whose spheres merge, plus all bond angles.

Caveats: `record_type=3d` often has no conformer for charged species
(bicarbonate, pyruvate, HPO₄²⁻), so those stay hand-written. Output is genuinely
non-planar, unlike the flat z=0 layouts elsewhere in `molecules.js`.

# tools/sdf2spec-generic.js

The same converter for molecules that are **not** amino acids. `sdf2spec.js`
exists mostly to force the library's fixed backbone order, because
`pep:{cC,oOH,hOH,nN,hN}` and `aminoacid-lab.html` index into it; a sugar or a
nucleotide has no such contract, so this one keeps the SDF's own atom order.

```bash
cd tools
curl -o beta-D-glucopyranose.sdf "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/name/beta-D-glucopyranose/SDF?record_type=3d"
node sdf2spec-generic.js beta-D-glucopyranose   # -> generated-specs-generic.json
```

Differences from `sdf2spec.js`:

- **no reindex** — atom order is the record's. Anything a page addresses by
  index (a `groups` map, a reaction site) must be read off the OUTPUT.
- **orientation** — if there is a 5-/6-ring, its mean plane becomes XY, so a
  pyranose lands face-on and the axial/equatorial pattern `check-molecules.js`
  audits is the thing you actually see. Otherwise the longest heavy-atom axis
  becomes +X.
- same global `SCALE` (1.9), same `optH` policy, same right-handed basis rule —
  negating one output component is a reflection and silently mirrors the
  molecule (see the comment in `sdf2spec.js`).

Used for `amp` in `molecules.js`.

## `dev-server.js` — local development only

```bash
node tools/dev-server.js             # default 8817; if busy, walks up to a free port
node tools/dev-server.js 9000        # explicit port; if busy, says what holds it and stops
```

Static file server with live reload. A CSS-only change swaps the stylesheet in
place (the page keeps its state); anything else reloads. Everything is served
`no-store`, which matters more than it sounds — python's `http.server` sends no
cache headers, so a browser will reuse a stale `scene.js` for a whole session and
a correct fix looks broken.

It injects its reload client into HTML **responses**, never into the files. The
repo deploys to GitHub Pages from the working tree, so the published pages must
stay exactly what is committed. `python3 -m http.server` to see what ships.

# tools/check-docs.js

Audits the claims `CLAUDE.md` and `SCIENCE.md` make about the code, for the same
reason `check-molecules.js` audits the claims a spec makes about chemistry: this
project's rule is that a claim ships with its assertion rather than relying on
someone noticing.

```bash
node tools/check-docs.js        # exits non-zero on failure
```

Three checks, chosen because every doc error found so far was one of them — an
**enumeration** that grew a member and wasn't updated:

- **scripts** — CLAUDE.md's per-page script table vs the real `<script>` tags.
  The table's `+ fx` rows are cumulative, so row order is load-bearing.
- **paths** — every file named in a doc or a module comment exists. A file named
  on purpose that doesn't (`engine.js`, TESTING.md's proposals) goes in
  `KNOWN_ABSENT` with a reason, and is then asserted **absent** — build it and
  the check fails until the doc calling it hypothetical is updated.
- **sections** — every `§n` / `§n.m` reference resolves to a real SCIENCE.md
  heading, and every section appears in CLAUDE.md's index (ranges like `§§2–8`
  are expanded).

It does **not** check whether prose is true. Nothing mechanical would have caught
SCIENCE.md claiming `stereo:` understood only `all-equatorial` long after it
learned `{axial}` and `{faces}`. See CLAUDE.md "Keeping the docs true" for the
part that is still on the reader.

# tools/check-handedness.js — the only mirror check

```bash
npm i && node tools/check-handedness.js
```

Compares every spec's committed `smiles` against a **stereo-specific** PubChem
record. This is the only check in the repo that can catch a global mirror, and
it caught a real one: every Skel-built sugar was the L-enantiomer (SCIENCE.md
§1.3). Internal checks cannot do this — a mirror preserves exactly the internal
consistency they test.

Two things make it trustworthy:

- **The control group.** Specs that came *from* PubChem are checked too. If those
  fail, the spec → molblock → RDKit path is broken and the geometry is innocent.
  `dAlanine` is in the list deliberately: it must come back **D**.
- **Anomer-specific reference names.** A bare `glucose` (CID 5793) leaves the
  anomeric centre undefined and would prove nothing. Every name is pinned.

Not wired into `check-molecules.js` — network plus a dev dependency, the same
reasoning as `cod-check.js` below. Run it after touching a ring builder or
adding a stereocentre.

# tools/cod-check.js — an audit, not a guard

Compares a Skel-built sugar against a **measured** crystal structure from the
[Crystallography Open Database](https://www.crystallography.net/). Every sugar in
`molecules.js` is constructed from our own `GL` table and idealised VSEPR angles,
so `check-molecules.js` can only prove the geometry matches what the spec
*declares*. This is the one thing that checks the declaration against reality.

```bash
curl -o 2101292.cif https://www.crystallography.net/cod/cif/2/10/12/2101292.cif
node tools/cod-check.js glucose 2101292.cif
```

Run it **once per molecule**, then record the verdict in that spec's
`validated:{}` and move on — see
[molecule-pipeline.md](../../docs/molecule-pipeline.md) item 6 for why it is
deliberately not wired into any check. Short version: the answer cannot go stale,
a network call inside a guard is a liability, and choosing the reference needs
judgement the script cannot supply.

Results so far (2026-07-30): `glucose` matches COD 2101292 on all five
substituents, torsions within 9.6°. `galactose` matches COD 2101291 on C4 — the
axial –OH that is the entire glucose/galactose lesson — with torsions within 3.4°.

Three things to know before trusting a run:

- **The anomeric carbon is reported separately, and it often differs.** C1 is α or
  β depending on which anomer crystallised; our sugars are β and the best
  galactose reference is α. A raw mismatch count would flag a correct spec.
- **Comparison is scale-invariant** — tilt from the ring plane, which face, and
  ring torsions. Never coordinates: our specs are multiplied by `SCALE` (1.9), so
  an RMSD against ångström crystal data means nothing.
- **Pyranoses and furanoses only, single ring.** It finds the ring by sugar
  numbering (`C1..Cn` plus `O5`/`O4`), so `ribose` and `deoxyribose` work but the
  disaccharides do not — `maltose` and `cellobiose` label their two rings `C1A` /
  `C1B`, and adjudicating a glycosidic link is a different job.

The header comment carries the reference-selection traps (predicted structures
filed as measurements, name searches that miss the structure you want,
high-pressure series in ordinary results). Read it before picking a new COD id;
that judgement is the expensive part, not the arithmetic.
