 *  bake-flat2d.js — a textbook 2D LAYOUT for every spec marked `flat:true`.
 *
 *  Run:  npm i @rdkit/rdkit && node tools/bake-flat2d.js
 *        (offline; prints rows to paste into the spec, like spec2smiles.js)
 *
 *  WHAT THIS IS FOR. molecule-viewer.html's 2D view is not a camera angle. It
 *  is the SAME atoms, moved: every sphere slides from where it really is to
 *  where a structural diagram would put it, and the bonds stretch to follow.
 *  That transition is the lesson — it says "this diagram and this model are one
 *  molecule" in a way no cut between two pictures can. molecule-builder.html
 *  does exactly this for its five small molecules, from hand-authored Lewis
 *  layouts. ATP has 31 heavy atoms and NADH 44, so theirs are computed.
 *
 *  WHY RDKit AND NOT SmilesDrawer. The page already draws a SmilesDrawer
 *  diagram (the "Diagram" view), so the obvious move is to reuse its vertex
 *  positions. It cannot be done honestly: SmilesDrawer lays out a SMILES
 *  string, whose atom order is RDKit's canonical ranking, and recovering which
 *  vertex is which spec atom means solving a graph isomorphism against the
 *  molecule the layout was derived from. A near-miss there does not look like a
 *  bug — it looks like a slightly odd diagram, with two oxygens swapped.
 *
 *  RDKit's own coordinate generator sidesteps the problem completely: it is
 *  handed a molblock built from the spec's heavy atoms and returns a molblock
 *  IN THAT SAME ORDER, so atom k of the layout is atom k of the spec by
 *  construction and there is nothing to match up. It is also the engine behind
 *  most published depictions, so the result is the layout a textbook would use.
 *
 *  HEAVY ATOMS ONLY, and the page hides hydrogens in the 2D view to match. A
 *  structural diagram folds them into -OH and -NH2 labels; laying out 12 of
 *  ATP's would be inventing positions for atoms the diagram does not draw.
 *
 *  UNITS ARE ÅNGSTRÖMS, like every other coordinate on disk
 *  (MolecularGeometry.md §1.5). RDKit works in its own layout units where a
 *  bond is 1.5, so the output is scaled to the molecule's OWN mean heavy-atom
 *  bond length — the flat drawing then has the same bond lengths as the model
 *  it grew out of, which is what stops the transition from looking like a zoom.
 *  `register()` does not touch this field, so the page applies SCALE itself;
 *  check-molecules.js asserts the mean bond length matches, which is the check
 *  that catches a layout pasted in at display scale (the silent 1.9×).
