# tools/sdf/ — the committed PubChem inputs

The source records for every `src:{path:'pubchem'}` spec in `molecules.js`.
Eight files, 36 KB. They are **build-time inputs, never a page dependency** — no
HTML here loads them, and nothing fetches at runtime.

Committed because path 2 was the one path that could not be re-run from this
repo: both converters read `${name}.sdf` from the working directory, and no
`.sdf` existed anywhere. See docs/molecule-pipeline.md item 2.

## Re-running a conversion

The converters read from the working directory, so run them from in here:

```bash
cd demos/tools/sdf
node ../sdf2spec.js glycine alanine serine cysteine   # -> generated-specs.json
node ../sdf2spec-generic.js amp                       # -> generated-specs-generic.json
```

Then compare against what is committed. `generated-specs*.json` are outputs, not
inputs — they are gitignored by the `_`-prefixed convention's spirit and should
not be committed.

## What is actually in here

`regen` in each spec's `src:` says how completely that file rebuilds the spec.
`check-molecules.js` enforces that the value is present and that the file named
by `src.sdf` exists.

| File | CID | Conformer | `regen` | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `glycine.sdf` | 750 | `000002EE00000001` | `exact` | rebuilds to 0.000 |
| `alanine.sdf` | 5950 | `0000173E00000001` | `exact` | rebuilds to 0.000 |
| `serine.sdf` | 5951 | `0000173F00000001` | `exact` | rebuilds to 0.000 |
| `cysteine.sdf` | 5862 | `000016E600000001` | `exact` | rebuilds to 0.000 |
| `amp.sdf` | 15938965 | `00F3359500000005` | `exact` | rebuilds to 0.000 |
| `proline.sdf` | 145742 | `0002394E00000001` | `manual` | `sdf2spec.js` throws on it |
| `glutamine.sdf` | 5961 | `0000174900000002` | **`lost`** | does *not* rebuild the spec |
| `glutamate.sdf` | 33032 | `0000810800000001` | **`lost`** | does *not* rebuild the spec |

Verified 2026-07-30. Five of eight rebuild exactly; the three that do not are
each a different problem, and the two marked `lost` are the ones to be careful
with.

## The three that are not straightforward

**`proline` — the converter refuses it.** `reindex` assumes the backbone order
`0 N · 1 H · 2 H · 3 Ca`, i.e. two hydrogens on the amino nitrogen. Proline's
nitrogen is secondary — one H, one bond into its own side-chain ring — so slot 2
has nothing to fill it and `sdf2spec.js` throws a `TypeError`. It is the one
proteinogenic amino acid the amino-acid converter cannot take, which is also,
not coincidentally, the fact `contrast-lab.html` teaches about it. The committed
spec was reindexed **by hand** and then put through `reframe()` alone. So this
file records the source truthfully; it just does not, on its own, reproduce the
spec.

**`glutamine` and `glutamate` — the source geometry is gone.** All ten
currently-published conformers of each CID were fetched and converted on
2026-07-30. None reproduces the committed spec: glutamine's best is |Δ| 6.357
(the default record 7.056), glutamate's best 5.827. The deviation climbs
outward from the backbone — N 0.5 → CG 1.5 → CD 2.3 → NE2 5.3 → terminal H 7.1 —
so the backbone reproduces and the flexible tail does not.

PubChem regenerates conformer sets, and whichever one these came from is no
longer published. **The files here are the closest available record, not a
reproduction.** The specs in `molecules.js` are now their own source.

> rotamer. The amide's edge-on presentation is a property of *that* conformer
> and the contrast lesson depends on it — this is exactly the class of change
> that renders beautifully and teaches something slightly different.

## The trap that produced a wrong conclusion, worth not repeating

`amp` is committed as the dianion, and its own comment always said the record
supplied it. The item 0 sweep queried the **name** `AMP`, which returns CID
6083 — the neutral acid: 37 atoms, two extra H on the phosphate oxygens, and a
different conformer. It read 14 fetched hydrogens against 12 committed and
concluded a stripping step had happened. None had. The right record is CID
15938965, `adenosine 5'-monophosphate(2-)`, and it rebuilds the spec exactly.

**A name query does not pin a charge state, and does not pin a stereocentre**
(the same reason PubChem's generic `glucose`, CID 5793, is the wrong reference
for a spec that claims an anomer). The four amino acids here were originally
fetched by name; they now carry a CID because of this. Their `query:` field is
kept only to record how they were *originally* asked for.

## What is still missing

Nothing verifies these files automatically. `check-molecules.js` confirms a
named `.sdf` exists, but re-running a conversion and diffing is a manual step —
the numbers in the table above came from a hand-run sweep. That check is now
*possible* offline for the first time, since the inputs are committed; building
it would be a small, self-contained addition.
