/* =============================================================================
 *  membrane/chemiosmosis.js — the proton circuit, as arithmetic.
 * =============================================================================
 *  NO THREE, NO DOM. Same split as pump.js: this file decides what the proton
 *  gradient IS and what the synthase is allowed to do with it, membrane.js
 *  draws the result, and check-chemiosmosis.js runs this in node.
 *
 *  Respiration and photosynthesis are one picture, mirrored. Something with
 *  energy to spend pumps protons across a membrane; ATP synthase lets them
 *  back down and makes ATP on the way. The sim's own words are `inside` (−y,
 *  the BOTTOM of the screen) and `outside` (+y, the top), and a CONTEXT says
 *  what those two halves are called AND which way the pumping runs:
 *
 *      plasma          top = outside the cell,     bottom = inside the cell
 *      mitochondrion   top = intermembrane space,  bottom = the matrix
 *      thylakoid       top = the stroma,           bottom = the lumen
 *
 *  A MITOCHONDRION PUMPS UP AND A THYLAKOID PUMPS DOWN, because every textbook
 *  cross-section puts the enclosed compartment at the bottom: the matrix
 *  there, and the lumen there too. So the pumped-into half is the top one in a
 *  mitochondrion and the bottom one in a thylakoid, and `pumpTo` is a real
 *  parameter rather than a label. Everything downstream — which side the
 *  synthase admits from, which way the pmf points, which mouth the complex
 *  loads at — is read off it, so the two organelles are one physics reflected
 *  rather than one physics renamed.
 *
 *  STOICHIOMETRY. A c-ring turn is one full rotation of the rotor and makes
 *  ATP_PER_TURN ATP for PROTONS_PER_TURN protons. Mammalian F1Fo has a c8
 *  ring: 8 H⁺ per 3 ATP, so ~2.7 H⁺ per ATP. Drawn as 9 per 3, because a
 *  third of a turn has to be a whole number of protons for a student to see
 *  the ratio at all. Declared, not hidden — a page may print it.
 *
 *  pH IS EXAGGERATED and in one number. A drawn proton stands for a great
 *  many, so PROTONS_PER_PH says how many drawn ones make a pH unit. Without
 *  it a dozen particles would read as six pH units.

     THE COMPLEX'S CYCLE, on pump.js's shape and for pump.js's reason.
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     A pump that snaps between an inward-open and an outward-open state has
     drawn a hole with a preference. The pump got a phase table so the
     student sees it TURN and sees both doors shut in between; the complex
     was written with a two-line gate test and read exactly as badly, so it
     gets the same table. Six phases, in a loop:

       1 load-H     inward-open. Two H⁺ step in from the inside.
       2 occlude    the fuel is spent. Both doors shut, the proton locked in.
       3 turn-out   the outer door opens: the machine has turned over.
       4 release-H  the proton leaves, to the outside.
       5 shut-out   the outer door closes on an EMPTY site.
       6 open-in    facing inside again, carrying nothing.

     Phases 5 and 6 are the ones that matter and the ones a shortcut drops.
     Coming back empty is what makes this a pump: a machine that could carry
     a proton home would be the leak it is supposed to prevent, and every
     frame of the return has to show an empty site to say so.

     TWO PROTONS A CYCLE, not one. The three complexes of the chain are drawn
     as a single machine, and a real one moves four H⁺ per pair of electrons,
     so one proton a turn would be the picture undercounting itself as well
     as too slow to build a gradient a student can watch. Two is what the
     site can hold and still read as two objects. Declared here, counted by
     the checker out of the cargo list rather than from this sentence.

     Same coordinates as pump.js: `u` is −1 at the inner mouth, 0 at the
     site, +1 at the outer, and nothing here knows an ångström.
